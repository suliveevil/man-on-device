NAME
       doxygen - documentation system for various programming languages

DESCRIPTION
       Doxygen is a documentation system for C++, C, Java, Objective-C, IDL
       (Corba and Microsoft flavors), Fortran, Python, VHDL and to some extent
       PHP, C#, and D.

       You can use doxygen in a number of ways:

       1) Use doxygen to generate a template configuration file*:

              doxygen [-s] -g [configName]

       2) Use doxygen to update an old configuration file*:

              doxygen [-s] -u [configName]

       3) Use doxygen to generate documentation using an existing
       configuration file*:

              doxygen [configName]

       4) Use doxygen to generate a template file controlling the layout of
       the generated documentation:

              doxygen -l [layoutFileName]
          In case layoutFileName is omitted DoxygenLayout.xml will be used as
       filename.
          If - is used for layoutFileName doxygen will write to standard
       output.

       5) Use doxygen to generate a template style sheet file for RTF, HTML or
       Latex.

              RTF: doxygen -w rtf styleSheetFile

              HTML: doxygen -w html headerFile footerFile styleSheetFile
              [configFile]

              LaTeX: doxygen -w latex headerFile footerFile styleSheetFile
              [configFile]

       6) Use doxygen to generate an rtf extensions file

              RTF: doxygen -e rtf extensionsFile
          If - is used for extensionsFile doxygen will write to standard
       output.

       7) Use doxygen to compare the used configuration file with the template
       configuration file

              doxygen -x [configFile]

          Use doxygen to compare the used configuration file with the template
       configuration file
          without replacing the environment variables or CMake type
       replacement variables

              doxygen -x_noenv [configFile]

       8) Use doxygen to show a list of built-in emojis.

              doxygen -f emoji outputFileName
          If - is used for outputFileName doxygen will write to standard
       output.

       *) If -s is specified the comments of the configuration items in the
       config file will be omitted.
          If configName is omitted 'Doxyfile' will be used as a default.
          If - is used for configFile doxygen will write / read the
       configuration to /from standard output / input.

       If -q is used for a doxygen documentation run, doxygen will see this as
       if QUIET=YES has been set.

       -v print version string, -V print extended version information

       -h,-? prints usage help information

       doxygen -d prints additional usage flags for debugging purposes
