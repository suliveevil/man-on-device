NAME
     bsqldb – batch SQL script processor using DB-Library

SYNOPSIS
     bsqldb [-hqv] [-S servername] [-D database] [-U username] [-P password]
            [-i input_file] [-o output_file] [-e error_file] [-H hostname]
            [-t field_term] [-R pivot_description]

DESCRIPTION
     bsqldb is a utility program distributed with FreeTDS.  bsqldb is a non-
     interactive equivalent of the "isql" utility programs distributed by
     Sybase and Microsoft. Like them, bsqldb uses the command "go" on a line
     by itself as a separator between batches. The last batch need not be
     followed by "go".  bsqldb makes use of the DB-Library API provided by
     FreeTDS. This API is of course also available to application developers.


OPTIONS
     -D database
             Database to use.

     -H hostname
             hostname Override name of client sent to server.

     -P password
             Database server password.

     -S servername
             Database server to which to connect.

     -U username
             Database server login name. If username is not provided, a domain
             login is attempted for TDS 7+ connections.

     -e error_file
             Name of file for errors.

     -h      Print column headers with the data to the same file.

     -i input_file
             Name of script file, containing SQL.

     -o output_file
             Name of output file, holding result data.

     -q      Do not print column metadata, return status, or rowcount.
             Overrides -h.

     -t field_term
             Specifies the field terminator. Default is two spaces (' ').
             Recognized escape sequences are tab ('\t'), carriage return
             ('\r'), newline ('\n'), and backslash ('\\').

     -v      Verbose mode, for more information about the DB-Library
             interaction.  This also reports the result set metadata,
             including and return code. All verbose data are written to
             standard error (or -e), so as not to interfere with the data
             stream.

     -R pivot_description
             Specify pivot trasformation. The format is ⟨down_columns⟩
             ⟨across_columns⟩ ⟨function⟩ ⟨value⟩.  Columns are specified but
             numbers.  The format of down columns and across columns is a
             comma separated list of columns.  function is either count, sum,
             min or max.

ENVIRONMENT
     DSQUERY default servername

NOTES
     bsqldb is a filter; it reads from standard input, writes to standard
     output, and writes errors to standard error. The -i, -o, and -e options
     override these defaults.

     The source code for bsqldb is intended as a model for DB-Library users.
     DB-Library has a rich set of functions, and it can be hard sometimes to
     understand how to use them, particularly the first time. If you find
     something about the source code unclear, you are encouraged to email the
     author your comments.

EXIT STATUS
     bsqldb exits 0 on success, and >0 if the server cannot process the query.

     For messages with severity > 10, bsqldb calls exit(3) with the severity
     level.  For example, if the severity level is 16, bsqldb will return an
     exit status of 16 to the shell.

HISTORY
     bsqldb first appeared in FreeTDS 0.63.

AUTHORS
     The bsqldb utility was written by James K. Lowden ⟨jklowden@freetds.org⟩.

BUGS
     Microsoft servers as of SQL Server 7.0 SP 3 do not return output
     parameters unless the RPC functions are used. This means bsqldb cannot
     return output parameters for stored procedures with these servers.
