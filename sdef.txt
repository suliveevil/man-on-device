NAME
     sdef – scripting definition extractor

SYNOPSIS
     sdef application

DESCRIPTION
     sdef gets the scripting definition (“sdef”) from the specified scriptable
     application and writes it to standard output.  The application does not
     have to have an actual sdef in it; sdef can translate from the older aete
     and Cocoa suite definition (scriptSuite/scriptTerminology pairs) formats.

     From there, you can examine the sdef directly, or pipe it to sdp(1) for
     further processing.

SEE ALSO
     sdp(1), sdef(5)
