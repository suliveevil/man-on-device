NAME
       psktool - GnuTLS PSK tool

SYNOPSIS
       psktool [-flags] [-flag [value]] [--option-name[[=| ]value]]

       All arguments must be options.

DESCRIPTION
       Program  that generates random keys for use with TLS-PSK. The keys are
       stored in hexadecimal format in a key file.


OPTIONS
       -d num, --debug=num
              Enable debugging.  This option takes an integer number as its
              argument.  The value of num is constrained to being:
                  in the range 0 through 9999

              Specifies the debug level.

       -s num, --keysize=num
              Specify the key size in bytes (default is 32-bytes or 256-bits).
              This option takes an integer number as its argument.  The value
              of num is constrained to being:
                  in the range 0 through 512


       -u str, --username=str
              Specify the username to use.


       -p str, --pskfile=str
              Specify a pre-shared key file.

              This option will specify the pre-shared key file to store the
              generated keys.

       --passwd
              This is an alias for the --pskfile option.

              NOTE: THIS OPTION IS DEPRECATED

       -v arg, --version=arg
              Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v', a
              simple version.  The `c' mode will print copyright information
              and `n' will print the full copyright notice.

       -h, --help
              Display usage information and exit.

       -!, --more-help
              Pass the extended usage information through a pager.



EXAMPLES
       To add a user 'psk_identity' in keys.psk for use with GnuTLS run:
           $ ./psktool -u psk_identity -p keys.psk
           Generating a random key for user 'psk_identity'
           Key stored to keys.psk
           $ cat keys.psk
           psk_identity:88f3824b3e5659f52d00e959bacab954b6540344
           $

       This command will create keys.psk if it does not exist and will add
       user 'psk_identity'.

EXIT STATUS
       One of the following exit values will be returned:

       0  (EXIT_SUCCESS)
              Successful program execution.

       1  (EXIT_FAILURE)
              The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
