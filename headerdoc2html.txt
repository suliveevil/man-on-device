NAME
     headerdoc2html â€“ header documentation processor

SYNOPSIS
     headerdoc2html [-HXdhquvx] [-o output_dir] file [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     Headerdoc2html processes the header file or files and generates HTML
     documentation based on specially-formatted comments.

     The options are as follows:

     -H    The -H option turns on inclusion of the htmlHeader line, as
           specified in the config file.

     -X    The -X option switches from HTML to XML output

     -d    The -d option turns on extra debugging output.

     -h    The -h option causes headerdoc to output an XML file containing
           metadata about the resulting document.

     -p    The -p option turns on the C preprocessor.

     -q    The -q option causes headerdoc to be excessively quiet.

     -u    The -u option causes headerdoc to produce unsorted output.

     -v    The -v option causes headerdoc to print version information.

     If no options are specified, headerdoc will produce directories
     containing its standard HTML output.

     For a complete list of flags, see the HeaderDoc User Guide.
