NAME
       isql, iusql - unixODBC interactive SQL command-line tools


SYNOPSIS
       isql DSN [USER [PASSWORD]] [options]


DESCRIPTION
       isql and iusql are command-line tools allowing users to execute SQL
       interactively or in batches.

       The tools provide several useful features, including an option to
       generate output wrapped in an HTML table.

       iusql is the same as isql but includes built-in Unicode support.  Some
       data sources only work with iusql.


ARGUMENTS
       DSN    The Data Source Name (DSN) used to connect to the SQL database.
              unixODBC looks for the specified DSN in /etc/odbc.ini and
              $HOME/.odbc.ini, with the latter taking precedence.

              When searching the configuration files, unixODBC looks for a
              bare name. If the DSN begins with a semicolon, it is treated as
              a connection string. The connection string can contain a DSN
              and/or other semicolon-separated parameters.


       USER   Specifies the database user or role under which the connection
              should be made.

              This parameter overrides any UID specified in the data source
              configuration files.


       PASSWORD
              Password required to access the database for the specified USER.

              This parameter overrides any PASSWORD specified in the data
              source configuration files.


OPTIONS
       -b     Run 'isql' in non-interactive batch mode. In this mode, 'isql'
              processes from standard input, expecting one SQL command per
              line.


       -dDELIMITER
              Delimit columns with the specified delimiter.


       -xHEX  Delimit columns with the character represented in hexadecimal by
              HEX. The hexadecimal code must be in the format 0xNN (e.g. 0x09
              for the TAB character).


       -w     Format the result as an HTML table.


       -c     Output the names of the columns on the first row. This option
              can only be used with the -d or -x options.


       -mNUM  Limit the column display width to NUM characters.


       -lLOCALE
              Set the character locale to LOCALE.


       -q     Wrap the character fields in double quotes.


       -3     Use calls from ODBC version 3.


       -n     Process multiple lines of SQL, terminated with the GO command.


       -e     Use SQLExecDirect instead of Prepare.


       -k     Use SQLDriverConnect.


       -v     Enable verbose mode, fully describing all errors. This option is
              useful for debugging.


       --version
              Display the program version.


       -LNUM  Set the maximum number of characters displayed from a character
              field to NUM.  The default value is 300 characters.


COMMANDS
       This section briefly describes some isql and iusql run-time commands.

       help
              List all tables in the database.

       help table
              List all columns in the table.

       help help
              List all help options.


EXAMPLES
       A bare DSN:

              $ iusql WebDB MyID MyPWD -w -b < My.sql

              Connects to the WebDB DSN as user MyID with password MyPWD, then
              executes the commands in the My.sql file and returns the results
              wrapped in an HTML table.

              Each line in My.sql must only contain one SQL command, except
              for the last line, which must be blank (unless the -n option is
              specified).


       A DSN in a connection string:

              Note the leading semicolon on the connection string.

              $ iusql ";DSN=WebDB" MyID MyPWD -w -b < My.sql

              Options in the DSN may be overridden in the connection string:

              $ iusql ";DSN=WebDB;Driver=PostgreSQL ODBC;UID=MyID;PASSWORD=secret;Debug=1;CommLog=1" -v


       A string DSN:

              A string DSN may be provided in its entirety, with no file DSN
              reference at all:

              $ iusql ";Driver=PostgreSQL Unicode;UID=MyID;PASSWORD=secret" -v


TROUBLESHOOTING
       Cryptic error messages

              Re-run isql or iusql with the -v flag to get more information
              from errors, and/or enable Trace mode in odbcinst.ini.


       Missing driver definition

              Check that the driver name specified by the Driver entry in the
              odbc.ini data-source definition is present in odbcinst.ini and
              exactly matches the odbcinst.ini [section name].


       Unloadable or incompatible driver

              If the ODBC driver is properly specified for the data source, it
              is possible that the driver is not loadable. Check for mix-ups
              between Unicode and ANSI drivers, and verify the driver paths in
              the odbcinst.ini [section name].


       Unicode data sources with ANSI clients

              Some data sources are Unicode-only and require the use of iusql.
              If isql reports
                [IM002][unixODBC][Driver Manager]Data source name not found and no default driver specified
                [ISQL]ERROR: Could not SQLConnect
              but the data source and driver required are listed by
                odbcinst -q -d
              and
                odbcinst -q -s
              then try iusql.
