NAME
       transicc - little cms ColorSpace conversion calculator.

SYNOPSIS
       transicc [options] [CGATSINPUT] [CGATSOUTPUT]

DESCRIPTION
       lcms is a standalone CMM engine, which deals with the color management.
       It implements a fast transformation between ICC profiles.  transicc is
       a lcms ColorSpace conversion calculator.

OPTIONS
       -b     Black point compensation.

       -c NUM Precalculates transform (0=Off, 1=Normal, 2=Hi-res, 3=LoRes)
              [defaults to 1].

       -d NUM Observer adaptation state (abs.col. only), (0..1.0, float value)
              [defaults to 0.0].

       -e     Encoded representation of numbers is not float (Option -w=use 16
              bits, Option -x=hexadecimal).

       -g     Marks out-of-gamut colors on softproof.

       -i profile
              Input profile (defaults to sRGB).

       -l     Transform by device-link profile.

       -m NUM SoftProof intent (0,1,2,3) [defaults to 0].

       -n     Terse output, intended for pipe usage.

       -o profile
              Output profile (defaults to sRGB).

       -q     Quantize CGATS to 8 bits.

       -s     Bounded mode.

       -t NUM Rendering intent
              0=Perceptual [default]
              1=Relative colorimetric
              2=Saturation
              3=Absolute colorimetric
              10=Perceptual preserving black ink
              11=Relative colorimetric preserving black ink
              12=Saturation preserving black ink
              13=Perceptual preserving black plane
              14=Relative colorimetric preserving black plane
              15=Saturation preserving black plane

       -v verbosity
              Verbosity level, (0=None, 1=Normal, 2=High, 3=Very High)
              [defaults to 1].

       -w     Use 16 bits.

       -x     Hexadecimal.

       You can use '*Lab' and '*xyz' as built-in profiles.
