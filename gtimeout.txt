NAME
       timeout - run a command with a time limit

SYNOPSIS
       timeout [OPTION] DURATION COMMAND [ARG]...
       timeout [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       Start COMMAND, and kill it if still running after DURATION.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options
       too.

       --preserve-status

              exit with the same status as COMMAND, even when the

              command times out

       --foreground

              when not running timeout directly from a shell prompt,

              allow COMMAND to read from the TTY and get TTY signals; in this
              mode, children of COMMAND will not be timed out

       -k, --kill-after=DURATION

              also send a KILL signal if COMMAND is still running

              this long after the initial signal was sent

       -s, --signal=SIGNAL

              specify the signal to be sent on timeout;

              SIGNAL may be a name like 'HUP' or a number; see 'kill -l' for a
              list of signals

       -v, --verbose
              diagnose to stderr any signal sent upon timeout

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       DURATION is a floating point number with an optional suffix: 's' for
       seconds (the default), 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours or 'd' for days.
       A duration of 0 disables the associated timeout.

       Upon timeout, send the TERM signal to COMMAND, if no other SIGNAL
       specified.  The TERM signal kills any process that does not block or
       catch that signal.  It may be necessary to use the KILL signal, since
       this signal can't be caught.

   EXIT status:
       124    if COMMAND times out, and --preserve-status is not specified

       125    if the timeout command itself fails

       126    if COMMAND is found but cannot be invoked

       127    if COMMAND cannot be found

       137    if COMMAND (or timeout itself) is sent the KILL (9) signal
              (128+9)

       -      the exit status of COMMAND otherwise

BUGS
       Some platforms don't currently support timeouts beyond the year 2038.
