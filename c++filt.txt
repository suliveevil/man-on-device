NAME
       llvm-cxxfilt - LLVM symbol name demangler

SYNOPSIS
       llvm-cxxfilt [options] [mangled names...]

DESCRIPTION
       llvm-cxxfilt is a symbol demangler that can be used as a replacement
       for the GNU c++filt tool. It takes a series of symbol names and prints
       their demangled form on the standard output stream. If a name cannot be
       demangled, it is simply printed as is.

       If no names are specified on the command-line, names are read
       interactively from the standard input stream. When reading names from
       standard input, each input line is split on characters that are not
       part of valid Itanium name manglings, i.e. characters that are not
       alphanumeric, '.', '$', or '_'. Separators between names are copied to
       the output as is.

EXAMPLE

          $ llvm-cxxfilt _Z3foov _Z3bari not_mangled
          foo()
          bar(int)
          not_mangled
          $ cat input.txt
          | _Z3foov *** _Z3bari *** not_mangled |
          $ llvm-cxxfilt < input.txt
          | foo() *** bar(int) *** not_mangled |

OPTIONS

       --format=<value>, -s
              Mangling scheme to assume. Valid values are auto (default,
              auto-detect the style) and gnu (assume GNU/Itanium style).

       --help, -h
              Print a summary of command line options.

       --no-strip-underscore, -n
              Do not strip a leading underscore. This is the default for all
              platforms except Mach-O based hosts.

       --strip-underscore, -_
              Strip a single leading underscore, if present, from each input
              name before demangling. On by default on Mach-O based platforms.

       --types, -t
              Attempt to demangle names as type names as well as function
              names.

       --version
              Display the version of the llvm-cxxfilt executable.

       @<FILE>
              Read command-line options from response file <FILE>.

EXIT STATUS
       llvm-cxxfilt returns 0 unless it encounters a usage error, in which
       case a non-zero exit code is returned.
