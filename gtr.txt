NAME
       tr - translate or delete characters

SYNOPSIS
       tr [OPTION]... STRING1 [STRING2]

DESCRIPTION
       Translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters from standard input,
       writing to standard output.  STRING1 and STRING2 specify arrays of
       characters ARRAY1 and ARRAY2 that control the action.

       -c, -C, --complement
              use the complement of ARRAY1

       -d, --delete
              delete characters in ARRAY1, do not translate

       -s, --squeeze-repeats
              replace each sequence of a repeated character that is listed in
              the last specified ARRAY, with a single occurrence of that
              character

       -t, --truncate-set1
              first truncate ARRAY1 to length of ARRAY2

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       ARRAYs are specified as strings of characters.  Most represent
       themselves.  Interpreted sequences are:

       \NNN   character with octal value NNN (1 to 3 octal digits)

       \\     backslash

       \a     audible BEL

       \b     backspace

       \f     form feed

       \n     new line

       \r     return

       \t     horizontal tab

       \v     vertical tab

       CHAR1-CHAR2
              all characters from CHAR1 to CHAR2 in ascending order

       [CHAR*]
              in ARRAY2, copies of CHAR until length of ARRAY1

       [CHAR*REPEAT]
              REPEAT copies of CHAR, REPEAT octal if starting with 0

       [:alnum:]
              all letters and digits

       [:alpha:]
              all letters

       [:blank:]
              all horizontal whitespace

       [:cntrl:]
              all control characters

       [:digit:]
              all digits

       [:graph:]
              all printable characters, not including space

       [:lower:]
              all lower case letters

       [:print:]
              all printable characters, including space

       [:punct:]
              all punctuation characters

       [:space:]
              all horizontal or vertical whitespace

       [:upper:]
              all upper case letters

       [:xdigit:]
              all hexadecimal digits

       [=CHAR=]
              all characters which are equivalent to CHAR

       Translation occurs if -d is not given and both STRING1 and STRING2
       appear.  -t may be used only when translating.  ARRAY2 is extended to
       length of ARRAY1 by repeating its last character as necessary.  Excess
       characters of ARRAY2 are ignored.  Character classes expand in
       unspecified order; while translating, [:lower:] and [:upper:] may be
       used in pairs to specify case conversion.  Squeezing occurs after
       translation or deletion.

BUGS
       Full support is available only for safe single-byte locales, in which
       every possible input byte represents a single character.  The C locale
       is safe in GNU systems, so you can avoid this issue in the shell by
       running LC_ALL=C tr instead of plain tr.
