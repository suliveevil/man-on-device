NAME
     tsql – utility to test FreeTDS connections and queries

SYNOPSIS
     tsql {-S servername [-I interface] | -H hostname [-L] [-p port]}
          [-D dbname] [-U username] [-P password] [-o options]
     tsql -C

DESCRIPTION
     tsql is a FreeTDS diagnostic tool. It uses the TDS protocol to connect to
     a Sybase or Microsoft SQL Server, and lets the user issue queries.  tsql
     does not use the FreeTDS client libraries. Instead, it uses only the
     lowest level library, libtds, to test the protocol implementation.

     tsql can be run in two ways, one which uses the freetds.conf and one
     which connects directly using the server's hostname and port.  The -H and
     -p parameters are provided to let the user verify a server is listening
     on the named host and port. These parameters override any configuration
     files and environment variables.  The -S parameter can be used to test
     the local configuration. FreeTDS will use freetds.conf (or equivalent)
     and environment variables in the normal way to determine the server's IP
     address and port. You can use -I to specify a filename, overriding
     FreeTDS's configuration file search algorithm.

OPTIONS
     -S servername
             database server to which to connect.

     -D dbname
             database to use.

     -I interface
             freetds.conf or interfaces file describing servername.

     -H hostname
             DNS hostname of the server.

     -p port
             port at which SQL Server is listening.

     -U username
             database login name. If username is not provided, a domain login
             is attempted for TDS 7+ connections.

     -P password
             database password.

     -L      list Microsoft server instances (with -H).

     -C      print some of the compile-time configuration parameters.

     -o options
             apply the options specified to every command.

             -f      No footer [result count]

             -h      No header [titles]

             -t      Print time

             -v      Print version

             -q      Quiet

     -a appname
             application name.

     -t colterm
             column terminator.

     -r rowterm
             row terminator.

     -r rowterm
             row terminator.

     -J charset
             character set.

     -v      verbose mode.

NOTES
     If you can connect with ‘tsql -S servername’,your basic FreeTDS
     installation is working.

     Typing ‘exit’,‘quit’,or ‘bye’ (or ^D) exits tsql.

     Typing ‘version’ displays the TDS protocol version.

     Command batches may be separated with ‘go’ or ‘GO’.If ‘GO’ the version
     string is reported before executing the batch.

     After prompting for the password (if not provided with -P), tsql will
     attempt to connect to the remote server.  tsql displays a counter
     indicating the number of seconds elapsed during the connection attempt.
     Typically, tsql immediately responds with a ‘1>’ prompt. If you see the
     counter (1, 2, 3, ...), most likely tsql is unable to connect to the
     indicated server.

     tsql is not a replacement for a complete isql such as sqsh
     (www.sqsh.org).  If you have suggestions for ways to make tsql more
     useful as a diagnostic tool, please post them to the FreeTDS mailing list
     for consideration.

HISTORY
     tsql first appeared in FreeTDS 0.60.

BUGS
     Several, to be sure, now that it's documented. :)
