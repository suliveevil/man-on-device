NAME
     opendiff â€“ Use FileMerge to graphically compare or merge file or
     directories

SYNOPSIS
     opendiff file1 file2 [-ancestor ancestorFile] [-merge mergeFile]
     opendiff dir1 dir2 [-ancestor ancestorDirectory] [-merge mergeDirectory]

DESCRIPTION
     opendiff is a command line utility that provides a convenient way to
     launch the FileMerge application from Terminal to graphically compare
     files or directories.  If FileMerge is already running, opendiff will
     connect to that running instance for the new comparison.  opendiff exits
     immediately after the comparison request has been sent to FileMerge.

     opendiff and FileMerge can be used to compare two files file1 and file2
     or to compare two directories dir1 and dir2.

     If the -ancestor flag is given, FileMerge will compare the two files or
     directories to a common ancestor.  This is useful if two people
     independently modify copies of a single original file or directory.

     FileMerge lets you merge two files or directories together to create a
     third file or directory.  To see the contents of a merged file, drag the
     splitter bar at the bottom of FileMerge's file comparison window.  The
     contents of the merged file can be directly edited within FileMerge.
     After editing, the merged file can be saved to the file (or into the
     directory) specified with the -merge flag.  If a destination is not
     specified with the -merge flag, FileMerge will ask for a destination file
     or directory when you try to save a merged file.

     For further information, please consult the Help information available
     from the FileMerge application.

FILES
     opendiff and FileMerge are installed as part of the Xcode Developer
     Tools.
