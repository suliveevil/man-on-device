NAME
       pod2texi - convert Pod to Texinfo

SYNOPSIS
         pod2texi [OPTION]... POD...

DESCRIPTION
       Translate Pod file(s) to Texinfo.  There are two basic modes of
       operation.  First, by default, each Pod is translated to a standalone
       Texinfo manual.

       Second, if "--base-level" is set higher than 0, each Pod is translated
       to a file suitable for @include, and one more file with a main menu and
       all the @include is generated.

OPTIONS
       --appendix-sections
           Use appendix sectioning commands (@appendix, ...) instead of the
           default numbered sectioning Texinfo @-commands (@chapter, @section,
           ...).

       --base-level=NUM|NAME
           Sets the level of the "head1" commands.  It may be an integer or a
           Texinfo sectioning command (without the "@"): 1 corresponds to the
           @chapter/@unnumbered level, 2 to the @section level, and so on.
           The default is 0, meaning that "head1" commands are still output as
           chapters, but the output is arranged as a standalone manual.

           If the level is not 0, the Pod file is rendered as a fragment of a
           Texinfo manual suitable for @include.  In this case, each Pod file
           has an additional sectioning command covering the entire file, one
           level above the "--base-level" value.  Therefore, to make each Pod
           file a chapter in a large manual, you should use "section" as the
           base level.

           For an example of making Texinfo out of the Perl documentation
           itself, see "contrib/perldoc-all" in the Texinfo source
           distribution.

       --debug=NUM
           Set debugging level to NUM.

       --headings-as-sections
           Use headings commands (@heading, ...) instead of the default
           numbered sectioning Texinfo @-commands (@chapter, @section, ...).
           The sectioning command covering the entire file output for each Pod
           file if --base-level is not 0 is a numbered command.

       --help
           Display help and exit.

       --menus
           Output node menus. If there is a main manual, its Top node menu is
           always output, since a master menu is generated. Other nodes menus
           are not output in the default case.

       --output=NAME
           Name for the first manual, or the main manual if there is a main
           manual.  Default is to write to standard output.

       --no-section-nodes
           Use anchors for sections instead of nodes.

       --no-fill-section-gaps
           Do not fill sectioning gaps with empty @unnumbered files.
           Ordinarily, it's good to keep the sectioning hierarchy intact.

       --preamble=STR
           Insert STR as top boilerplate before menu and includes.  If STR is
           set to "-", read the top boilerplate from the standard input.  The
           default top boilerplate is a minimal beginning for a Texinfo
           document.

       --setfilename=STR
           Use STR in top boilerplate before menu and includes for
           @setfilename.  No @setfilename is output in the default case.

       --subdir=NAME
           If there is a main manual with include files (each corresponding to
           an input Pod file), then those include files are put in directory
           NAME.

       --unnumbered-sections
           Use unnumbered sectioning commands (@unnumbered, ...) instead of
           the default numbered sectioning Texinfo @-commands (@chapter,
           @section, ...).

       --top=TOP
           Name of the @top element for the main manual.  May contain Texinfo
           code.

       --version
           Display version information and exit.
