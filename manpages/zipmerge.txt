NAME
     zipmerge â€“ merge zip archives

SYNOPSIS
     zipmerge [-DhIiSsV] target-zip source-zip [source-zip ...]

DESCRIPTION
     zipmerge merges the source zip archives source-zip into the target zip
     archive target-zip.  By default, files in the source zip archives
     overwrite existing files of the same name in the target zip archive.

     -D   Ignore directory components in file name comparisons.  This option
          is slow for archives with many files.

     -h   Display a short help message and exit.

     -I   Ignore case in file name comparisons This option is slow for
          archives with many files.

     -i   Ask before overwriting files.  See also -s.

     -S   Do not overwrite files that have the same size and CRC32 in both the
          source and target archives.

     -s   When -i is given, do not before overwriting files that have the same
          size and CRC32.

     -V   Display version information and exit.

EXIT STATUS

CAVEATS
     zipmerge uses one open file descriptor per zip archive.  If you need to
     merge a lot of zip archives, check your shell's file descriptor ulimit
     and either increase it or run zipmerge multiple times with e.g. 1000
     source zip archives each time.
