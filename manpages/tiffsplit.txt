NAME
       tiffsplit - split a multi-image TIFF into single-image TIFF files

SYNOPSIS
       tiffsplit src.tif [ prefix ]

DESCRIPTION
       tiffsplit takes a multi-directory (page) TIFF file and creates one or
       more single-directory (page) TIFF files from it.  The output files are
       given names created by concatenating a prefix, a lexically ordered
       suffix in the range [aaa-zzz], the suffix .tif (e.g.  xaaa.tif,
       xaab.tif, ..., xzzz.tif).  If a prefix is not specified on the command
       line, the default prefix of x is used.

OPTIONS
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       tiffsplit exits with one of the following values:
       0      Success
       1      An error occurred either reading the input or writing results.

BUGS
       Only a select set of ``known tags'' is copied when splitting.
