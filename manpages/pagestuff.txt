NAME
       pagestuff - Mach-O file page analysis tool

SYNOPSIS
       pagestuff file [-arch arch_flag] [[-a] [-p] | [pagenumber...]]

DESCRIPTION
       pagestuff shows how a structure of a Mach-O or universal file
       corresponds to logical pages on the current system. Structural
       information includes the location and extent of file headers, sections
       and segments, symbol tables, code signatures, etc. When displaying a
       universal file, all architectures will be shown unless otherwise
       specified by the -arch flag.

       The options to pagestuff(1) are:

       -arch arch_type
              Specifies the architecture, arch_type, of the file for pagestuff
              to operate on when the file is a universal file.  (See arch(3)
              for the currently known arch_types.)  When this option is used
              the logical page numbers start from the beginning of the
              architecture file within the universal file.

       -pagesize pagesize
              Specifies the page size to use when computing logical page
              boundaries. By default pagestuff will use the page size of the
              current system.

       -a     Display all pages in the file.

       -p     Print a list of the sections of the specified file, offsets and
              lengths.  When displaying a universal file, all archs will be
              displayed unless Print a list of the sections of the specified
              Mach-O file, with offsets and lengths. Note that the size(1)
              tool displays a much more concise listing given the `-l -m -x'
              arguments.
