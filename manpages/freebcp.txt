DESCRIPTION
     freebcp is a utility program distributed with FreeTDS.  freebcp
     replicates (in part at least) the functionality of the bcp utility
     programs distributed by Sybase and Microsoft.  freebcp makes use of the
     DB-Library bcp API provided by FreeTDS. This API is also available to
     application developers.

     The manual pages or online help for Sybase or SQL Server can be
     referenced for more detailed information on bcp functionality.

TABLES AND FILES
     database
             The name of the database containing object to be copied.
             Optional if the table/view is in the default database for
             username.

     schema  The schema of the object being copied. If not provided, the
             default schema for username is used.

     object  The name of the database object you wish to access, typically a
             table. It can also be a view.  All views can be read; some can be
             written, subject to constraints.  With queryout, object can also
             be an SQL query.

     in      Copy data from a host file to a database table.

     out     Copy data from a database table to a host file.

     queryout
             indicates that table_name is in fact SQL, rather than a database
             object.  freebcp will execute the query and write the results to
             a file. (It is a good idea to have the query return one and only
             one result set.)

     datafile
             The name of an operating system file.

OPTIONS
     -A packet_size
             Set the size of a TDS packet to packet_size.  Not sure why you
             would want to do this, except as an experiment.

     -D dbname
             The name of the default database to use.  Overrides default
             database associated with the login account.  Causes freebcp to
             issue a USE dbname command immediately after logging in, before
             commencing BCP operations.

     -E      Write the data in datafile to the table's IDENTITY column.
             Without this flag, the identity data present in the datafile will
             be ignored, and new IDENTITY values will be generated for the
             imported rows.

     -F firstrow
             The first row to copy from the input file or database table. The
             default is the first row, row 1.

     -I interfaces
             The name and location of the interfaces file to search when
             connecting to servername. Overrides freetds.conf.

     -L lastrow
             The last row to copy from an input file  or database table. The
             default is the last row.

     -O options
             SQL text to set connection options prior to the bcp operation.
             If options is a valid filename, the SQL is read from the file
             instead. Sometimes needed for queryout.  Example: -O `SET
             QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON'.

     -P password
             The password associated with username.

     -S servername
             The name of the Database Server to which to connect.

     -T textsize
             For text or image columns, set the maximum number of characters
             to request from the server. Defaults to the setting in
             freetds.conf.  If not specified anywhere, defaults to the full
             size of the data.

     -U username
             A database login name.  For TDS 7+ connections, a domain login is
             attempted if username is not provided.

     -b batchsize
             The number of rows per batch of data copied. Batching applies
             only when you are bulk copying into the database. Each batch of
             data is effectively “committed” into the database. The default
             value for batchsize is 1000.

     -c      The host data file is (or will be) in "character" format, i.e., a
             text file. Encoding is determined by the client charset attribute
             in freetds.conf.

     -d      Turn off any logging. (Unintuitive, perhaps.)

     -e errfile
             Write errors to errfile.  For uploads.  Includes line and column
             information, and the row data.

     -f formatfile
             The format of the host data file is described by formatfile.  The
             layout of formatfile is identical to that understood by the
             Sybase and Microsoft bcp utilities, but is too complicated to
             describe here.

     -h hints
             Set bcp hints. For valid values, cf.  bcp_options() in the
             FreeTDS Reference Manual.

     -m maxerror
             Stop after encountering maxerror errors. Default 10.

     -n      The host data file is in “native” format.  This is a format that
             freebcp will be able to process, but is not portable or readable.

     -r row_term
             The row terminator for a character file.  May be more than one
             character.  Default is newline ('\n'). Cf.  -c, above.

     -t field_term
             The field terminator for character file. Also known as a column
             delimiter. May be more than one character.  Default is tab
             ('\t'). Cf.  -c, above.

     -v

     -V      Print the version information and exit.

     -i inputfile
             Read input data from file specified.

     -o outputfile
             Write output data to file specified.

     -C charset
             Specify character set to use to talk to server.

ENVIRONMENT
     DSQUERY default servername

NOTES
     When connecting to a Sybase database server, it is required that the TDS
     5.0 protocol be used. When connecting to a Microsoft SQL Server 2000
     database server, the TDS 7 (or later) protocol is required.

     Sybase and Microsoft define different versions of the bcp portion of TDS
     4.2.  Because FreeTDS has no way of knowing which type of server it's
     connected to, freebcp does not support version 4.2 of the TDS protocol.

HISTORY
     freebcp first appeared in FreeTDS 0.60

AUTHORS
     The freebcp utility was written by Bill Thompson
     ⟨thompbil@exchange.uk.ml.com⟩

BUGS
     Currently, there is no support for text data types in freebcp, when SQL
     Server 2000 is the target server.
