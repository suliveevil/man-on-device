NAME
       codesign_allocate -  add code signing data to a Mach-O file

SYNOPSIS
       codesign_allocate -i oldfile [ -a arch size ]... [ -A cputype
       cpusubtype size ]... -o newfile

DESCRIPTION
       codesign_allocate sets up a Mach-O file used by the dynamic linker so
       space for code signing data of the specified size for the specified
       architecture is embedded in the Mach-O file.  The program must be
       passed one -a argument or one -A argument for each architecture in a
       universal file, or exactly one -a or -A for a thin file.

       -i oldfile
              specifies the input file as oldfile.

       -o newfile
              specifies the output file as newfile.

       -a arch size
              specifies for the architecture arch that the size of the code
              signing data is to be size.  The value of size must be a
              multiple of 16.

       -A cputype cpusubtype size
              specifies for the architecture as a pair of decimal integers for
              the cputype and cpusubtype that the size of the code signing
              data is to be size.  The value of size must be a multiple of 16.

       -r     remove the code signature data and the LC_CODE_SIGNATURE load
              command.  This is the same as specifiying the -a or -A option
              with a size of zero.

       -p     page align the code signature data by padding string table and
              changing its size.  This is not the default as codesign(1)
              currently can't use this option.
