DESCRIPTION
     xctrace is used to record new Instruments.app .trace files using the
     specified recording template.  It also allows for converting supported
     converting files of supported input types  into .trace files and
     exporting data from .trace files to parseable formats like xml.

     Available commands and their options:

     help        General help or help specific to command argument

     record      Perform a new recording on the specified device and target
                 with the given template. Resulting .trace file can be viewed
                 in Instruments.app or exported using xctrace.  Recording can
                 target all processes, attach to an existing process or launch
                 a new one.

                 --output path     Save the trace to the specified path.  A
                                   path to an existing trace file can be used
                                   if --append-run is specified. In this case
                                   the provided template will be ignored and
                                   the template in the existing trace will be
                                   used.  If the passed path is a directory, a
                                   uniquely named file will be created in it.
                                   If the path contains the extension .trace,
                                   a new trace will be created with that name
                                   at the specified path or working directory.

                 --append-run      Allows to target an existing trace file.
                                   Specifying it causes new run to be
                                   appended. New run is recorded with the
                                   template that this existing trace file was
                                   initially recorded with.

                 --template path | name
                                   Records using given trace template name or
                                   path. If name is specified, template needs
                                   to be either bundled with an installed
                                   Instruments Package or located in the
                                   Application Support directory for
                                   Instruments. To retrieve available
                                   templates, run xctrace list templates.

                 --instrument name
                                   Adds Instrument with the specified name to
                                   the recording configuration. To retrieve
                                   available Instruments, run xctrace list
                                   instruments.

                 --device name | UDID
                                   Record on a device with the given name or
                                   UDID. If not specified, then local device
                                   is chosen for the recording.  If the word
                                   simulator is included, devices of simulator
                                   types will be preferred.  To get list of
                                   available devices, run xctrace list
                                   devices.

                 --time-limit time [ms|s|m|h]
                                   Limits the recording to the specified time
                                   period. Example: "--time-limit 5s" or
                                   "--time-limit 1m"

                 --window duration [ms|s|m]
                                   Configure trace to operate in windowed
                                   mode, where trace buffer acts as a ring
                                   buffer, removing old events to make room
                                   for new ones. Example: "--window 5s"

                 --all-processes   Record all processes running on the system.

                 --attach pid | name
                                   Attach and record running process with the
                                   given name or pid.

                 --launch -- command [arguments]
                                   Launch and record process with the given
                                   name or path and provided arguments list.
                                   This option should be passed as the last
                                   one in the xctrace command invocation.

                 --package file    Install the given Instruments Package

                                   is set to the local Mac.  Can be pointing
                                   to a file or be specified as - , which
                                   causes standard input of xctrace to be
                                   passed into the standard input of a target
                                   process.

                 --target-stdout - | file
                                   Redirects standard output stream of a
