NAME
       dftest - Shows display filter byte-code, for debugging dfilter
       routines.

SYNOPSIS
       dftest [ <filter> ]

DESCRIPTION
       dftest is a simple tool which compiles a display filter and shows its
       bytecode.  Please refer to doc/README.display_filter for a description
       of the DFVM (Display Filter Virtual Machine) Byte Codes.

OPTIONS
       filter

           The display filter expression. If needed it has to be quoted.

DIAGNOSTIC OPTIONS
       --log-level <level>
           Set the active log level.  Supported levels in lowest to highest
           order are "noisy", "debug", "info", "message", "warning",
           "critical", and "error".  Messages at each level and higher will be
           printed, for example "warning" prints "warning", "critical", and
           "error" messages and "noisy" prints all messages.  Levels are case
           insensitive.

       --log-fatal <level>
           Abort the program if any messages are logged at the specified level
           or higher.  For example, "warning" aborts on any "warning",
           "critical", or "error" messages.

       --log-domains <list>
           Only print messages for the specified log domains, e.g.
           "GUI,Epan,sshdump".  List of domains must be comma-separated.

       --log-debug <list>
           Force the specified domains to log at the "debug" level.  List of
           domains must be comma-separated.

       --log-noisy <list>
           Force the specified domains to log at the "noisy" level.  List of
           domains must be comma-separated.

       --log-file <path>
           Write log messages and stderr output to the specified file.

EXAMPLES
       Show how the IP protocol is filtered:

           dftest ip

       Shows how frame 150 is filtered:

           dftest "frame.number == 150"
