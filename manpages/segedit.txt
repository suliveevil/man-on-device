NAME
       segedit - extract and replace sections from object files

SYNOPSIS
       segedit input_file [-extract seg_name sect_name data_file] ...
       segedit input_file [-replace seg_name sect_name data_file] ... -output
       output_file

DESCRIPTION
       segedit extracts or replaces named sections from the input_file. When
       extracting sections, segedit will write the contents of each requested
       section into data_file. When replacing sections, segedit will write a
       new output_file formed from the input_file and the requested
       replacement section content from data_file. The segment and section
       names are the same as those given to ld(1) with the -sectcreate option.
       The segment and section names of an object file can be examined with
       the -l option to otool(1).  Only sections in segments that have no
       relocation to or from them (i.e., segments marked with the SG_NORELOC
       flag) can be replaced but all sections can be extracted.

       The options to segedit(1):

       -extract seg_name sect_name data_file
              Extracts each section specified by the segment and section names
              and places the contents in the specified data_file. If the
              output file is `-' the section contents will be written to the
              standard output.

       -replace seg_name sect_name data_file
              Replaces each section specified by the segment and section names
              and takes the new section content from the specified data_file.
              The -output output_file option must also be specified. The
              resulting size of the section will be rounded to a multiple of 4
              bytes and padded with zero bytes if necessary.

       -output output_file
              Specifies the new file to create when replacing sections.

LIMITATIONS
       Only Mach-O format files that are laid out in a contiguous address
       space and with their segments in increasing address order can have
       their segments replaced by this program.  This layout is what ld(1)
       produces by default.

       Only sections in segments that have no relocation to or from them
       (i.e., segments marked with the SG_NORELOC flag) can be replaced.

       segedit will not extract or replace sections from universal files. If
       necessary, use lipo(1) to extract the desired Mach-O files from a
       universal file before running segedit.
