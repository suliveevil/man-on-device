NAME
     zipcmp â€“ compare contents of zip archives

SYNOPSIS
     zipcmp [-ChipqstVv] archive1 archive2

DESCRIPTION
     zipcmp compares the zip archives or directories archive1 and archive2 and
     checks if they contain the same files, comparing their names,
     uncompressed sizes, and CRCs.  File order and compressed size differences
     are ignored.

     Supported options:

     -C   Check consistency of archives.  Results in an error if archive is
          inconsistent or not valid according to the zip specification.

     -h   Display a short help message and exit.

     -i   Compare names ignoring case distinctions.

     -p   Enable paranoid checks.  Compares extra fields, comments, and other
          meta data.  (Automatically disabled if one of the archives is a
          directory.)  These checks are skipped for files where the data
          differs.

     -q   Quiet mode.  Compare -v.

     -s   Print a summary of how many files where added and removed.

     -t   Test zip files by comparing the contents to their checksums.

     -V   Display version information and exit.

     -v   Verbose mode.  Print details about differences to stdout.  (This is
          the default.)

EXIT STATUS
     zipcmp exits 0 if the two archives contain the same files, 1 if they
     differ, and >1 if an error occurred.
