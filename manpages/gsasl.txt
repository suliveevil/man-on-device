NAME
       gsasl - SASL library command line interface

SYNOPSIS
       gsasl [OPTION]... [HOST [PORT]]...

DESCRIPTION
       Authenticate user to a server using Simple Authentication and Security
       Layer.  Currently IMAP and SMTP servers are supported.  This is a
       command line interface for the GNU SASL library.

       -h, --help
              Print help and exit

       -V, --version
              Print version and exit

   Commands:
       -c, --client
              Act as client.  (default=on)

       -s, --server
              Act as server.  (default=off)

       --client-mechanisms
              Write name of supported client mechanisms separated by space to
              stdout.  (default=off)

       --server-mechanisms
              Write name of supported server mechanisms separated by space to
              stdout.  (default=off)

       -k, --mkpasswd
              Derive password. Provide --mechanism as SCRAM-SHA-1 or
              SCRAM-SHA-256.  The required inputs are password (through
              --password or read from terminal) and optional inputs are
              iteration count (through --iteration-count, or defaulting to
              65536) and salt (through --salt, or generated randomly).  The
              output is a string of the form
              "{mech}count,salt,stored-key,server-key[,salted-password]" where
              "mech" is the mechanism, "count" is the number of times password
              was hashed, "salt" is the provided/generated base64-encoded
              salt, "stored-key" and "server-key" are the two derived and
              base64-encoded server-side keys.  When --verbose is provided,
              "salted-password" will be included as the hex-encoded
              PBKDF2-derived password.  (default=off)

   Network options:
       --connect=HOST[:PORT]
              Connect to TCP server and negotiate on stream instead of
              stdin/stdout. PORT is the protocol service, or an integer
              denoting the port, and defaults to 143 (imap) if not specified.
              Also sets the --hostname default.

   Generic options:
       -d, --application-data
              After authentication, read data from stdin and run it through
              the mechanism's security layer and print it base64 encoded to
              stdout. The default is to terminate after authentication.
              (default=on)

       --imap Use a IMAP-like logon procedure (client only).  Also sets the
              --service default to 'imap'.  (default=off)

       --smtp Use a SMTP-like logon procedure (client only).  Also sets the
              --service default to 'smtp'.  (default=off)

       -m, --mechanism=STRING
              Mechanism to use.

       --no-client-first
              Disallow client to send data first (client only).  (default=off)

   SASL mechanism options (they are prompted for when required):
       -n, --anonymous-token=STRING
              Token for anonymous authentication, usually mail address
              (ANONYMOUS only).

       -a, --authentication-id=STRING
              Identity of credential owner.

       -z, --authorization-id=STRING Identity to request service for.

       -p, --password=STRING
              Password for authentication (insecure for non-testing purposes).

       -r, --realm=STRING
              Realm. Defaults to hostname.

       --passcode=NUMBER
              Passcode for authentication (SECURID only).

       --service=STRING
              Set the requested service name (should be a registered GSSAPI
              host based service name).

       --hostname=STRING
              Set the name of the server with the requested service.

       --service-name=STRING
              Set the generic server name in case of a replicated server
              (DIGEST-MD5 only).

       --enable-cram-md5-validate
              Validate CRAM-MD5 challenge and response

       interactively.
              (default=off)

       --disable-cleartext-validate
              Disable cleartext validate hook, forcing server

       to prompt for password.
              (default=off)

       --quality-of-protection=TYPE
              How application payload will be protected.

       'qop-auth' means no protection, 'qop-int'
              means integrity protection, 'qop-conf' means integrity and
              confidentialiy protection.  Currently only used by DIGEST-MD5,
              where the default is 'qop-int'.

       --iteration-count=NUMBER
              Indicate PBKDF2 hash iteration count (SCRAM only).
              (default=`65536')

       --salt=B64DATA
              Indicate PBKDF2 salt as base64-encoded string (SCRAM only).

   STARTTLS options:
       --starttls
              Force use of STARTTLS.  The default is to use STARTTLS when
              available.  (default=off)

       --no-starttls
              Unconditionally disable STARTTLS.  (default=off)

       --x509-ca-file=FILE
              File containing one or more X.509 Certificate Authorities
              certificates in PEM format, used to verify the certificate
              received from the server.  If not specified, verification uses
              system trust settings.  If FILE is the empty string, don't fail
              on X.509 server certificates verification errors.

       --x509-cert-file=FILE
              File containing client X.509 certificate in PEM format.  Used
              together with --x509-key-file to specify the certificate/key
              pair.

       --x509-key-file=FILE
              Private key for the client X.509 certificate in PEM format.
              Used together with --x509-key-file to specify the

       --priority=STRING
              Cipher priority string.
