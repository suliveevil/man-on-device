NAME
       reordercap - Reorder input file by timestamp into output file

SYNOPSIS
       reordercap [ -n ] [ -v ] <infile> <outfile>

DESCRIPTION
       Reordercap is a program that reads an input capture file and rewrites
       the frames to an output capture file, but with the frames sorted by
       increasing timestamp.

       This functionality may be useful when capture files have been created
       by combining frames from more than one well-synchronised source, but
       the frames have not been combined in strict time order.

       Reordercap writes the output capture file in the same format as the
       input capture file.

       Reordercap is able to detect, read and write the same capture files
       that are supported by Wireshark.  The input file doesnâ€™t need a
       specific filename extension; the file format and an optional gzip, zstd
       or lz4 compression will be automatically detected.  Near the beginning
       of the DESCRIPTION section of wireshark(1) or
       <https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html> is a detailed
       description of the way Wireshark handles this, which is the same way
       reordercap handles this.

OPTIONS
       -n

           When the -n option is used, reordercap will not write out the
           output file if it finds that the input file is already in order.

       -v

           Print the version and exit.

DIAGNOSTIC OPTIONS
       --log-level <level>
           Set the active log level.  Supported levels in lowest to highest
           order are "noisy", "debug", "info", "message", "warning",
           "critical", and "error".  Messages at each level and higher will be
           printed, for example "warning" prints "warning", "critical", and
           "error" messages and "noisy" prints all messages.  Levels are case
           insensitive.

       --log-fatal <level>
           Abort the program if any messages are logged at the specified level
           or higher.  For example, "warning" aborts on any "warning",
           "critical", or "error" messages.

       --log-domains <list>
           Only print messages for the specified log domains, e.g.
           "GUI,Epan,sshdump".  List of domains must be comma-separated.

       --log-debug <list>
           Force the specified domains to log at the "debug" level.  List of
           domains must be comma-separated.

       --log-noisy <list>
           Force the specified domains to log at the "noisy" level.  List of
           domains must be comma-separated.

       --log-file <path>
           Write log messages and stderr output to the specified file.

NOTES
       This is the manual page for Reordercap 4.0.2.  Reordercap is part of
       the Wireshark distribution.  The latest version of Wireshark can be
       found at  <https://www.wireshark.org>.

       It may make sense to move this functionality into editcap, or perhaps
       mergecap, in which case reordercap could be retired.

       HTML versions of the Wireshark project man pages are available at
       <https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages>.
