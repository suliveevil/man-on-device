NAME
     /usr/bin/ResMerger â€“ Merges resource forks or files into one resource
     file (DEPRECATED)

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/bin/ResMerger [-fileCreator <fileCreator>] [-fileType <fileType>]
                        [-[a]ppend] [-srcIs RSRC | DF] [-dstIs RSRC | DF]
                        file ... -o <dest-file>

DESCRIPTION
     Tools supporting Carbon development, including /usr/bin/ResMerger, were
     deprecated with Xcode 6.

     The /usr/bin/ResMerger command merges the Carbon Resource Manager
     resource data in multiple files into a single file.  The output file may
     be one of the input files.

     The /usr/bin/ResMerger command takes the following flags and arguments:

     -fileCreator <fileCreator>
       Sets the HFS creator type of the output file.  The default is '????'.

     -fileType <fileType>
       Sets the HFS file type of the output file.  The default is '????'.

     -[a]ppend
       Append to output file, rather than overwriting it.

     -srcIs RSRC | DF
       The fork in which to look for resources in the input file(s).  The
       default is the data fork (DF).

     -dstIs RSRC | DF
       The fork in which to write resources in the output file.  The default
       is the data fork (DF).

     -skip <type>
       Specifies resource type to skip during the resource merge. May be used
       multiple times, to specify multiple resource types to skip.

     file
       Specifies one or more input files.  Note that as there is only one
       srcIs flag, the input files must be homogenous, that is, the resources
       must be in the same fork of all input files.

     -o <dest-file>
       Specifies the output file.  If the fork designated by -dstIs exists, it
       is overwritten unless the -a flag is provided; if it does not exist, it
       is created.
