NAME
       adig - print information collected from Domain Name System (DNS)
       servers

SYNOPSIS
       adig [OPTION]... NAME...

DESCRIPTION
       Send queries to DNS servers about NAME and print received information,
       where NAME is a valid DNS name (e.g. www.example.com, 1.2.3.10.in-
       addr.arpa).

       This utility comes with the c-ares asynchronous resolver library.

OPTIONS
       -c class
              Set the query class.  Possible values for class are NY, CHAOS,
              HS, IN (default).

       -d     Print some extra debugging output.

       -f flag
              Add a flag.  Possible values for flag are igntc, noaliases,
              norecurse, primary, stayopen, usevc.

       -h, --help
              Display this help and exit.

       -T port
              Use specified TCP port to connect to DNS server.

       -s server
              Connect to specified DNS server, instead of the system's default
              one(s).

       -t type
              Query records of specified type.  Possible values for type are A
              (default), AAAA, AFSDB, ANY, AXFR, CNAME, GPOS, HINFO, ISDN,
              KEY, LOC, MAILA, MAILB, MB, MD, MF, MG, MINFO, MR, MX, NAPTR,
              NS, NSAP, NSAP_PTR, NULL, PTR, PX, RP, RT, SIG, SOA, SRV, TXT,
              URI, WKS, X25,

       -U port
              Use specified UDP port to connect to DNS server.

       -x     For an IPv4 -t PTR a.b.c.d lookup, query for
              d.c.b.a.in-addr.arpa. This more often gives correct names in the
              ANSWER.
              For an IPv6 -t PTR addr lookup, query for a.b.c....z.IP6.ARPA.

       -xx    As for -x and an IPv6 address, compact a.b.c....z.IP6.ARPA. into
              a RFC-2673 bit-string.  This compacted bit-string form is not
              supported by many DNS-servers.
