NAME
     ld – linker

SYNOPSIS
     ld files...  [options] [-o outputfile]

DESCRIPTION
     The ld command combines several object files and libraries, resolves
     references, and produces an output file.  ld can produce a final linked
     image (executable, dylib, or bundle), or with the -r option, produce
     another object file.  If the -o option is not used, the output file
     produced is named "a.out".

   Universal
     The linker accepts universal (multiple-architecture) input files, but
     always creates a "thin" (single-architecture), standard Mach-O output
     file.  The architecture for the output file is specified using the -arch
     option.  If this option is not used, ld attempts to determine the output
     architecture by examining the object files in command line order.  The
     first "thin" architecture determines that of the output file.  If no
     input object file is a "thin" file, the native 32-bit architecture for
     the host is used.

     Usually, ld is not used directly.  Instead the compiler driver invokes
     ld. The compiler driver can be passed multiple -arch options and it will
     create a universal final linked image by invoking ld multiple times and
     then running lipo(1) merge the outputs into a universal file.

   Layout
     The object files are loaded in the order in which they are specified on
     the command line.  The segments and the sections in those segments will
     appear in the output file in the order they are encountered in the object
     files being linked.  All zero fill sections will appear after all non-
     zero fill sections in their segments.

   Libraries
     A static library (aka static archive) is a collection of .o files with a
     table of contents that lists the global symbols in the .o files.  ld will
     only pull .o files out of a static library if needed to resolve some
     symbol reference.  Unlike traditional linkers, ld will continually search
     a static library while linking. There is no need to specify a static
     library multiple times on the command line.

     A dynamic library (aka dylib or framework) is a final linked image.
     Putting a dynamic library on the command line causes two things: 1) The
     generated final linked image will have encoded that it depends on that
     dynamic library. 2) Exported symbols from the dynamic library are used to
     resolve references.

     Both dynamic and static libraries are searched as they appear on the
     command line.

   Search paths
     ld maintains a list of directories to search for a library or framework
     to use.  The default library search path is /usr/lib then /usr/local/lib.
     The -L option will add a new library search path.  The default framework
     search path is /Library/Frameworks then /System/Library/Frameworks.
     (Note: previously, /Network/Library/Frameworks was at the end of the
     default path.  If you need that functionality, you need to explicitly add
     -F/Network/Library/Frameworks).  The -F option will add a new framework
     search path.  The -Z option will remove the standard search paths.  The
     -syslibroot option will prepend a prefix to all search paths.

   Two-level namespace
     By default all references resolved to a dynamic library record the
     library to which they were resolved. At runtime, dyld uses that
     information to directly resolve symbols.  The alternative is to use the
     -flat_namespace option.  With flat namespace, the library is not
     recorded.  At runtime, dyld will search each dynamic library in load
     order when resolving symbols. This is slower, but more like how other
     operating systems resolve symbols.

   Indirect dynamic libraries
     If the command line specifies to link against dylib A, and when dylib A
     was built it linked against dylib B, then B is considered an indirect
     dylib.  When linking for two-level namespace, ld does not look at
     indirect dylibs, except when re-exported by a direct dylibs.  On the
     other hand when linking for flat namespace, ld does load all indirect
     dylibs and uses them to resolve references.  Even though indirect dylibs
     are specified via a full path, ld first uses the specified search paths
     to locate each indirect dylib.  If one cannot be found using the search
     paths, the full path is used.

   Dynamic libraries undefines
     When linking for two-level namespace, ld does not verify that undefines
     in dylibs actually exist.  But when linking for flat namespace, ld does
     check that all undefines from all loaded dylibs have a matching
     definition.  This is sometimes used to force selected functions to be
     loaded from a static library.

OPTIONS
   Options that control the kind of output
     -execute
             The default.  Produce a mach-o main executable that has file type
             MH_EXECUTE.

     -dylib  Produce a mach-o shared library that has file type MH_DYLIB.

     -bundle
             Produce a mach-o bundle that has file type MH_BUNDLE.

     -r      Merges object files to produce another mach-o object file with
             file type MH_OBJECT.

     -dylinker
             Produce a mach-o dylinker that has file type MH_DYLINKER.  Only
             used when building dyld.

     -dynamic
             The default.  Implied by -dylib, -bundle, or -execute

     -static
             Produces a mach-o file that does not use the dyld.  Only used
             building the kernel.

     -preload
             Produces a mach-o file in which the mach_header, load commands,
             and symbol table are not in any segment.  This output type is
             used for firmware or embedded development where the segments are
             copied out of the mach-o into ROM/Flash.

     -arch arch_name
             Specifies which architecture (e.g. ppc, ppc64, i386, x86_64) the
             output file should be.

     -o path
             Specifies the name and location of the output file.  If not
             specified, `a.out' is used.

   Options that control libraries
     -lx     This option tells the linker to search for libx.dylib or libx.a
             in the library search path.  If string x is of the form y.o, then
             that file is searched for in the same places, but without
             prepending `lib' or appending `.a' or `.dylib' to the filename.

     -needed-lx
             This is the same as the -lx but means to really link with the
             dylib even if no symbols are used from it.  Thus, it can be used
             suppress warnings about unused dylibs.

     -reexport-lx
             This is the same as the -lx but specifies that the all symbols in
             library x should be available to clients linking to the library
             being created.  This was previously done with a separate
             -sub_library option.

     -upward-lx
             This is the same as the -lx but specifies that the dylib is an
             upward dependency.

     -hidden-lx
             This is the same as the -lx for locating a static library, but
             treats all global symbols from the static library as if they are
             visibility hidden.  Useful when building a dynamic library that
             uses a static library but does not want to export anything from
             that static library.

     -weak-lx
             This is the same as the -lx but forces the library and all
             references to it to be marked as weak imports.  That is, the
             library is allowed to be missing at runtime.

     -needed_library path_to_dylib
             This is the same as placing path_to_dylib on the link line but
             means to really link with the dylib even if no symbols are used
             from it.  Thus, it can be used suppress warnings about unused
             dylibs.

     -reexport_library path_to_library
             This is the same as listing a file name path to a library on the
             link line and it specifies that the all symbols in library path
             should be available to clients linking to the library being
             created.  This was previously done with a separate -sub_library
             option.

     -upward_library path_to_library
             This is the same as listing a file name path to a library on the
             link line but also marks the dylib as an upward dependency.

     -weak_library path_to_library
             This is the same as listing a file name path to a library on the
             link line except that it forces the library and all references to
             it to be marked as weak imports.

     -Ldir   Add dir to the list of directories in which to search for
             libraries.  Directories specified with -L are searched in the
             order they appear on the command line and before the default
             search path. In Xcode4 and later, there can be a space between
             the -L and directory.

     -Z      Do not search the standard directories when searching for
             libraries and frameworks.

     -syslibroot rootdir
             Prepend rootdir to all search paths when searching for libraries
             or frameworks.

     -search_paths_first
             This is now the default (in Xcode4 tools).  When processing -lx
             the linker now searches each directory in its library search
             paths for `libx.dylib' then `libx.a' before the moving on to the
             next path in the library search path.

     -search_dylibs_first
             Changes the searching behavior for libraries.  The default is
             that when processing -lx the linker searches each directory in
             its library search paths for `libx.dylib' then `libx.a'.  This
             option changes the behavior to first search for a file of the
             form `libx.dylib' in each directory in the library search path,
             then a file of the form `libx.a' is searched for in the library
             search paths.  This option restores the search behavior of the
             linker prior to Xcode4.

     -framework name[,suffix]
             This option tells the linker to search for `name.framework/name'
             the framework search path.  If the optional suffix is specified
             the framework is first searched for the name with the suffix and
             then without (e.g. look for `name.framework/name_suffix' first,
             if not there try `name.framework/name').

     -needed_framework name[,suffix]
             This is the same as the -framework name[,suffix] but means to
             really link with the framework even if no symbols are used from
             it.  Thus, it can be used suppress warnings about unused dylibs.

     -weak_framework name[,suffix]
             This is the same as the -framework name[,suffix] but forces the
             framework and all references to it to be marked as weak imports.
             Note: due to a clang optimizations, if functions are not marked
             weak, the compiler will optimize out any checks if the function
             address is NULL.

     -reexport_framework name[,suffix]
             This is the same as the -framework name[,suffix] but also
             specifies that the all symbols in that framework should be
             available to clients linking to the library being created.  This
             was previously done with a separate -sub_umbrella option.

     -upward_framework name[,suffix]
             This is the same as the -framework name[,suffix] but also
             specifies that the framework is an upward dependency.

     -Fdir   Add dir to the list of directories in which to search for
             frameworks.  Directories specified with -F are searched in the
             order they appear on the command line and before the default
             search path. In Xcode4 and later, there can be a space between
             the -F and directory.

     -all_load
             Loads all members of static archive libraries.

     -ObjC   Loads all members of static archive libraries that implement an
             Objective-C class or category.

     -force_load path_to_archive
             Loads all members of the specified static archive library.  Note:
             -all_load forces all members of all archives to be loaded.  This
             option allows you to target a specific archive.

     -load_hidden path_to_archive
             Uses specified static library as usual, but treats all global
             symbols from the static library to as if they are visibility
             hidden.  Useful when building a dynamic library that uses a
             static library but does not want to export anything from that
             static library.

     -image_suffix suffix
             Search for libraries and frameworks with suffix and then without.

   Options that control additional content
     -sectcreate segname sectname file
             The section sectname in the segment segname is created from the
             contents of file file. If there's a section (segname,sectname)
             from any other input, the linker will append the content from the
             file to that section.

     -add_empty_section segname sectname
             An empty section named sectname in the segment segname. If any of
             the inputs contains a section (segname,sectname), that section
             will be included in the output, and this option will be ignored.

     -add_ast_path file
             The linker will add a N_AST stab symbol to the output file where
             the string is the path pointed by file and its values is the
             modification time of the file.

     -filelist file[,dirname]
             Specifies that the linker should link the files listed in file.
             This is an alternative to listing the files on the command line.
             The file names are listed one per line separated only by
             newlines. (Spaces and tabs are assumed to be part of the file
             name.)  If the optional directory name, dirname is specified, it
             is prepended to each name in the list file.

     -dtrace file
             Enables dtrace static probes when producing a final linked image.
             The file file must be a DTrace script which declares the static
             probes.

   Options that control optimizations
     -dead_strip
             Remove functions and data that are unreachable by the entry point
             or exported symbols.

     -order_file file
             Alters the order in which functions and data are laid out.  For
             each section in the output file, any symbol in that section that
             are specified in the order file file is moved to the start of its
             section and laid out in the same order as in the order file file.
             Order files are text files with one symbol name per line.  Lines
             starting with a # are comments.  A symbol name may be optionally
             preceded with its object file leaf name and a colon (e.g.
             foo.o:_foo).  This is useful for static functions/data that occur
             in multiple files.  A symbol name may also be optionally preceded
             with the architecture (e.g. ppc:_foo or ppc:foo.o:_foo).  This
             enables you to have one order file that works for multiple
             architectures.  Literal c-strings may be ordered by by quoting
             the string (e.g. "Hello, world\n") in the order file.

     -no_order_inits
             When the -order_file option is not used, the linker lays out
             functions in object file order and it moves all initializer
             routines to the start of the __text section and terminator
             routines to the end. Use this option to disable the automatic
             rearrangement of initializers and terminators.

     -platform_version platform min_version sdk_version
             This is set to indicate the platform, oldest supported version of
             that platform that output is to be used on, and the SDK that the
             output was built against.  platform is a numeric value as defined
             in <mach-o/loader.h>, or it may be one of the following strings:
             • macos
             • ios
             • tvos
             • watchos
             • bridgeos
             • mac-catalyst
             • ios-simulator
             • tvos-simulator
             • watchos-simulator
             • driverkit
             Specifying a newer min or SDK version enables the linker to
             assume features of that OS or SDK in the output file. The format
             of min_version and sdk_version is a version number such as 10.13
             or 10.14

     -macos_version_min version
             This is set to indicate the oldest macOS version that that the
             output is to be used on.  Specifying a later version enables the
             linker to assumes features of that OS in the output file.  The
             format of version is a macOS version number such as 10.9 or 10.14

     -ios_version_min version
             This is set to indicate the oldest iOS version that that the
             output is to be used on.  Specifying a later version enables the
             linker to assumes features of that OS in the output file.  The
             format of version is an iOS version number such as 3.1 or 4.0

     -image_base address
             Specifies the preferred load address for a dylib or bundle. The
             argument address is a hexadecimal number with an optional leading
             0x.  By choosing non-overlapping address for all dylibs and
             bundles that a program loads, launch time can be improved because
             dyld will not need to "rebase" the image (that is, adjust
             pointers within the image to work at the loaded address).  It is
             often easier to not use this option, but instead use the
             rebase(1) tool, and give it a list of dylibs.  It will then
             choose non-overlapping addresses for the list and rebase them
             all. When building a position independent executable, this option
             will be ignored.  This option is also called -seg1addr for
             compatibility.

     -no_implicit_dylibs
             When creating a two-level namespace final linked image, normally
             the linker will hoist up public dylibs that are implicitly linked
             to make the two-level namespace encoding more efficient for dyld.
             For example, Cocoa re-exports AppKit and AppKit re-exports
             Foundation.  If you link with -framework Cocoa and use a symbol
             from Foundation, the linker will implicitly add a load command to
             load Foundation and encode the symbol as coming from Foundation.
             If you use this option, the linker will not add a load command
             for Foundation and encode the symbol as coming from Cocoa.  Then
             at runtime dyld will have to search Cocoa and AppKit before
             finding the symbol in Foundation.

     -no_zero_fill_sections
             By default the linker moves all zero fill sections to the end of
             the __DATA segment and configures them to use no space on disk.
             This option suppresses that optimization, so zero-filled data
             occupies space on disk in a final linked image.

     -merge_zero_fill_sections
             Causes all zero-fill sections in the __DATA segment to be merged
             into one __zerofill section.

     -no_branch_islands
             Disables linker creation of branch islands which allows images to
             be created that are larger than the maximum branch distance.
             Useful with -preload when code is in multiple sections but all
             are within the branch range.

   Options when creating a dynamic library (dylib)
     -install_name name
             Sets an internal "install path" (LC_ID_DYLIB) in a dynamic
             library. Any clients linked against the library will record that
             path as the way dyld should locate this library.  If this option
             is not specified, then the -o path will be used.  This option is
             also called -dylib_install_name for compatibility.

     -mark_dead_strippable_dylib
             Specifies that the dylib being built can be dead strip by any
             client.  That is, the dylib has no initialization side effects.
             So if a client links against the dylib, but never uses any symbol
             from it, the linker can optimize away the use of the dylib.

     -compatibility_version number
             Specifies the compatibility version number of the library.  When
             a library is loaded by dyld, the compatibility version is checked
             and if the program's version is greater that the library's
             version, it is an error.  The format of number is X[.Y[.Z]] where
             X must be a positive non-zero number less than or equal to 65535,
             and .Y and .Z are optional and if present must be non-negative
             numbers less than or equal to 255.  If the compatibility version
             number is not specified, it has a value of 0 and no checking is
             done when the library is used.  This option is also called
             -dylib_compatibility_version for compatibility.

     -current_version number
             Specifies the current version number of the library. The current
             version of the library can be obtained programmatically by the
             user of the library so it can determine exactly which version of
             the library it is using.  The format of number is X[.Y[.Z]] where
             X must be a positive non-zero number less than or equal to 65535,
             and .Y and .Z are optional and if present must be non-negative
             numbers less than or equal to 255.  If the version number is not
             specified, it has a value of 0.  This option is also called
             -dylib_current_version for compatibility.

   Options when creating a main executable
     -pie    This makes a special kind of main executable that is position
             independent (PIE).  On Mac OS X 10.5 and later, the OS the OS
             will load a PIE at a random address each time it is executed.
             You cannot create a PIE from .o files compiled with -mdynamic-no-
             pic.  That means the codegen is less optimal, but the address
             randomization adds some security. When targeting Mac OS X 10.7 or
             later PIE is the default for main executables.

     -no_pie
             Do not make a position independent executable (PIE).  This is the
             default, when targeting 10.6 and earlier.

     -pagezero_size size
             By default the linker creates an unreadable segment starting at
             address zero named __PAGEZERO.  Its existence will cause a bus
             error if a NULL pointer is dereferenced.  The argument size is a
             hexadecimal number with an optional leading 0x.  If size is zero,
             the linker will not generate a page zero segment.  By default on
             32-bit architectures the page zero size is 4KB.  On 64-bit
             architectures, the default size is 4GB.

     -stack_size size
             Specifies the maximum stack size for the main thread in a
             program.  Without this option a program has a 8MB stack.  The
             argument size is a hexadecimal number with an optional leading
             0x. The size should be a multiple of the architecture's page size
             (4KB or 16KB).

     -allow_stack_execute
             Marks executable so that all stacks in the task will be given
             stack execution privilege. This includes pthread stacks. This
             option is only valid when targeting architectures that support
             stack execution (i.e. Intel).

     -export_dynamic
             Preserves all global symbols in main executables during LTO.
             Without this option, Link Time Optimization is allowed to inline
             and remove global functions. This option is used when a main
             executable may load a plug-in which requires certain symbols from
             the main executable.

   Options when creating a bundle
     -bundle_loader executable
             This specifies the executable that will be loading the bundle
             output file being linked.  Undefined symbols from the bundle are
             checked against the specified executable like it was one of the
             dynamic libraries the bundle was linked with.

   Options when creating an object file
     -keep_private_externs
             Don't turn private external (aka visibility=hidden) symbols into
             static symbols, but rather leave them as private external in the
             resulting object file.

     -d      Force definition of common symbols.  That is, transform tentative
             definitions into real definitions.

   Options that control symbol resolution
     -exported_symbols_list filename
             The specified filename contains a list of global symbol names
             that will remain as global symbols in the output file.  All other
             global symbols will be treated as if they were marked as
             __private_extern__ (aka visibility=hidden) and will not be global
             in the output file. The symbol names listed in filename must be
             one per line.  Leading and trailing white space are not part of
             the symbol name.  Lines starting with # are ignored, as are lines
             with only white space.  Some wildcards (similar to shell file
             matching) are supported.  The * matches zero or more characters.
             The ? matches one character.  [abc] matches one character which
             must be an 'a', 'b', or 'c'.  [a-z] matches any single lower case
             letter from 'a' to 'z'.

     -exported_symbol symbol
             The specified symbol is added to the list of global symbols names
             that will remain as global symbols in the output file.  This
             option can be used multiple times.  For short lists, this can be
             more convenient than creating a file and using
             -exported_symbols_list.

     -no_exported_symbols
             Useful for main executable that don't have plugins and thus need
             no symbol exports.

     -unexported_symbols_list file
             The specified filename contains a list of global symbol names
             that will not remain as global symbols in the output file.  The
             symbols will be treated as if they were marked as
             __private_extern__ (aka visibility=hidden) and will not be global
             in the output file. The symbol names listed in filename must be
             one per line.  Leading and trailing white space are not part of
             the symbol name.  Lines starting with # are ignored, as are lines
             with only white space.  Some wildcards (similar to shell file
             matching) are supported.  The * matches zero or more characters.
             The ? matches one character.  [abc] matches one character which
             must be an 'a', 'b', or 'c'.  [a-z] matches any single lower case
             letter from 'a' to 'z'.

     -unexported_symbol symbol
             The specified symbol is added to the list of global symbols names
             that will not remain as global symbols in the output file.  This
             option can be used multiple times.  For short lists, this can be
             more convenient than creating a file and using
             -unexported_symbols_list.

     -reexported_symbols_list file
             The specified filename contains a list of symbol names that are
             implemented in a dependent dylib and should be re-exported
             through the dylib being created.

     -alias symbol_name alternate_symbol_name
             Create an alias named alternate_symbol_name for the symbol
             symbol_name.  By default the alias symbol has global visibility.
             This option was previous the -idef:indir option.

     -alias_list filename
             The specified filename contains a list of aliases. The symbol
             name and its alias are on one line, separated by whitespace.
             Lines starting with # are ignored.

     -flat_namespace
             Alters how symbols are resolved at build time and runtime.  With
             -two_levelnamespace (the default), the linker only searches
             dylibs on the command line for symbols, and records in which
             dylib they were found.  With -flat_namespace, the linker searches
             all dylibs on the command line and all dylibs those original
             dylibs depend on.  The linker does not record which dylib an
             external symbol came from, so at runtime dyld again searches all
             images and uses the first definition it finds.  In addition, any
             undefines in loaded flat_namespace dylibs must be resolvable at
             build time.

     -u symbol_name
             Specified that symbol symbol_name must be defined for the link to
             succeed.  This is useful to force selected functions to be loaded
             from a static library.

     -U symbol_name
             Specified that it is ok for symbol_name to have no definition.
             With -two_levelnamespace, the resulting symbol will be marked
             dynamic_lookup which means dyld will search all loaded images.

     -undefined treatment
             Specifies how undefined symbols are to be treated. Options are:
             error, warning, suppress, or dynamic_lookup.  The default is
             error. Note: dynamic_lookup that depends on lazy binding will not
             work with chained fixups.

     -rpath path
             Add path to the runpath search path list for image being created.
             At runtime, dyld uses the runpath when searching for dylibs whose
             load path begins with @rpath/.

     -commons treatment
             Specifies how commons (aka tentative definitions) are resolved
             with respect to dylibs.  Options are: ignore_dylibs, use_dylibs,
             error.  The default is ignore_dylibs which means the linker will
             turn a tentative definition in an object file into a real
             definition and not even check dylibs for conflicts.  The dylibs
             option means the linker should check linked dylibs for
             definitions and use them to replace tentative definitions from
             object files.  The error option means the linker should issue an
             error whenever a tentative definition in an object file conflicts
             with an external symbol in a linked dylib.  See also
             -warn_commons.

   Options for introspecting the linker
     -why_load
             Log why each object file in a static library is loaded. That is,
             what symbol was needed.  Also called -whyload for compatibility.

     -why_live symbol_name
             Logs a chain of references to symbol_name.  Only applicable with
             -dead_strip .  It can help debug why something that you think
             should be dead strip removed is not removed.  See
             -exported_symbols_list for syntax and use of wildcards.

     -print_statistics
             Logs information about the amount of memory and time the linker
             used.

     -t      Logs each file (object, archive, or dylib) the linker loads.
             Useful for debugging problems with search paths where the wrong
             library is loaded.

     -order_file_statistics
             Logs information about the processing of a -order_file.

     -map map_file_path
             Writes a map file to the specified path which details all symbols
             and their addresses in the output image.

   Options for controlling symbol table optimizations
     -S      Do not put debug information (STABS or DWARF) in the output file.

     -x      Do not put non-global symbols in the output file's symbol table.
             Non-global symbols are useful when debugging and getting symbol
             names in back traces, but are not used at runtime. If -x is used
             with -r non-global symbol names are not removed, but instead
             replaced with a unique, dummy name that will be automatically
             removed when linked into a final linked image.  This allows dead
             code stripping, which uses symbols to break up code and data, to
             work properly and provides the security of having source symbol
             names removed.

     -non_global_symbols_strip_list filename
             The specified filename contains a list of non-global symbol names
             that should be removed from the output file's symbol table.  All
             other non-global symbol names will remain in the output files
             symbol table. See -exported_symbols_list for syntax and use of
             wildcards.

     -non_global_symbols_no_strip_list filename
             The specified filename contains a list of non-global symbol names
             that should be remain in the output file's symbol table.  All
             other symbol names will be removed from the output file's symbol
             table. See -exported_symbols_list for syntax and use of
             wildcards.

     -oso_prefix prefix-path
             When generating the debug map, the linker will remove the
             specified prefix-path from the path in OSO symbols. This can be
             used so to help build servers generate identical binaries.  If
             '.' is passed as argument, the linker will expand the argument to
             the current working directory.

   Options for Bitcode build flow
     -bitcode_bundle
             Generates an embedded bitcode bundle in the output binary. The
             bitcode bundle is embedded in __LLVM, __bundle section.  This
             option requires all the object files, static libraries and user
             frameworks/dylibs contain bitcode.  Note: not all the linker
             options are supported to use together with -bitcode_bundle.

     -bitcode_hide_symbols
             Specifies this option together with -bitcode_bundle to hide all
             non-exported symbols from output bitcode bundle.  The hide symbol
             process might not be reversible. To obtain a reverse mapping file
             to recover all the symbols, use -bitcode_symbol_map option.

     -bitcode_symbol_map path
             Specifies the output for bitcode symbol reverse mapping
             (.bcsymbolmap). If path is an existing directory,
             UUID.bcsymbolmap will be written to that directory.  Otherwise,
             the reverse map will be written to a file at path.

   Rarely used Options
     @response_file_path
             Inserts contents of file at response_file_path into arguments.
             This allows for linker command line args to be store in a file.
             Note: ld is normally invoked through clang, and clang also
             interprets @file on the command line.  To have clang ignore the
             @file and pass it through to ld, use -Wl,@file.

     -v      Prints the version of the linker.

     -adhoc_codesign
             Directs the linker to add an ad-hoc codesignature to the output
             file. The default for Apple Silicon binaries is to be ad-hoc
             codesigned.

     -no_adhoc_codesign
             Directs the linker to not add ad-hoc codesignature to the output
             file, even for Apple Silicon binaries.

     -data_const
             By default the linker moves some data sections into __DATA_CONST
             if it knows the target OS version supports that.  This option
             option overrides the default behavior and forces the use of
             __DATA_CONST.

     -no_data_const
             By default the linker moves some data sections into __DATA_CONST
             if it knows the target OS version supports that.  This option
             option overrides the default behavior and forces the linker to
             never move sections to __DATA_CONST.

     -const_selrefs
             By default the linker moves __objc_selrefs section into
             __DATA_CONST if it knows the target OS version supports that.
             This option option overrides the default behavior and forces
             __objc_selrefs being in __DATA_CONST.  Note this only applies if
             the __DATA_CONST segment is enabled.  See -data_const for more
             information.

     -no_const_selrefs
             By default the linker moves __objc_selrefs section into
             __DATA_CONST if it knows the target OS version supports that.
             This option option overrides the default behavior and keeps the
             __objc_selrefs section in __DATA.

     -version_details
             Prints the version info about the linker in JSON

     -no_weak_imports
             Error if any symbols are weak imports (i.e. allowed to be
             unresolved (NULL) at runtime). Useful for config based projects
             that assume they are built and run on the same OS version.

     -no_deduplicate
             Don't run deduplication pass in linker

     -verbose_deduplicate
             Prints names of functions that are eliminated by deduplication
             and total code savings size.

     -no_inits
             Error if the output contains any static initializers

     -no_warn_inits
             Do not warn if the output contains any static initializers

     -debug_variant
             Do not warn about issues that are only problems for binaries
             shipping to customers.

     -unaligned_pointers treatment
             Specifies how unaligned pointers in __DATA segments should be
             handled. Options are: 'warning', 'error', or 'suppress'.  The
             default for arm64e is 'error' and for all other architectures it
             is 'suppress'.

     -dirty_data_list filename
             Specifies a file containing the names of data symbols likely to
             be dirtied.  If the linker is creating a __DATA_DIRTY segment,
             those symbols will be moved to that segment.

     -max_default_common_align value
             Any common symbols (aka tentative definitions, or uninitialized
             (zeroed) variables) that have no explicit alignment are normally
             aligned to their next power of two size (e.g. a 240 byte array is
             256 aligned).  This option lets you reduce the max alignment.
             For instance, a value of 0x40 would reduce the alignment for a
             240 byte array to 64 bytes (instead of 256). The value specified
             must be a hexadecimal power of two If -max_default_common_align
             is not used, the default alignment is already limited to 0x8
             (2^3) bytes for -preload and 0x8000 (2^15) for all other output
             types.

     -move_to_rw_segment segment_name filename
             Moves data symbols to another segment.  The command line option
             specifies the target segment name and a path to a file containing
             a list of symbols to move.  Comments can be added to the symbol
             file by starting a line with a #.  If there are multiple
             instances of a symbol name (for instance a "static int foo=5;" in
             multiple files) the symbol name in the symbol list file can be
             prefixed with the object file name (e.g. "init.o:_foo") to move a
             specific instance.

     -move_to_ro_segment segment_name filename
             Moves code symbols to another segment.  The command line option
             specifies the target segment name and a path to a file containing
             a list of symbols to move.  Comments can be added to the symbol
             file by starting a line with a #.  If there are multiple
             instances of a symbol name (for instance a "static int foo() {}"
             in multiple files) the symbol name in the symbol list file can be
             prefixed with the object file name (e.g. "init.o:_foo") to move a
             specific instance.

     -rename_section orgSegment orgSection newSegment newSection
             Renames section orgSegment/orgSection to newSegment/newSection.

     -rename_segment orgSegment newSegment
             Renames all sections with orgSegment segment name to have
             newSegment segment name.

     -trace_symbol_layout
             For using in debugging -rename_section, -rename_segment,
             -move_to_ro_segment, and -move_to_rw_segment.  This option prints
             out a line show where and why each symbol was moved.  Note: These
             options do chain.  For each symbol, the linker first checks
             -move_to_ro_segment and -move_to_rw_segment. Next it applies any
             -rename_section options, and lastly and -rename_segment options.

     -section_order segname colon_separated_section_list
             Only for use with -preload.  Specifies the order that sections
             with the specified segment should be layout out.  For example:
             "-section_order __ROM __text:__const:__cstring".

     -segment_order colon_separated_segment_list
             Only for use with -preload.  Specifies the order segments should
             be layout out.  For example: "-segment_order __ROM:__ROM2:__RAM".

     -allow_heap_execute
             Normally i386 main executables will be marked so that the Mac OS
             X 10.7 and later kernel will only allow pages with the x-bit to
             execute instructions. This option overrides that behavior and
             allows instructions on any page to be executed.

     -application_extension
             Specifies that the code is being linked for use in an application
             extension.  The linker will then validate that any dynamic
             libraries linked against are safe for use in application
             extensions.

     -no_application_extension
             Specifies that the code is being linked is not safe for use in an
             application extension.  For instance, can be used when creating a
             framework that should not be used in an application extension.

     -fatal_warnings
             Causes the linker to exit with a non-zero value if any warnings
             were emitted.

     -no_eh_labels
             Normally in -r mode, the linker produces .eh labels on all FDEs
             in the __eh_frame section.  This option suppresses those labels.
             Those labels are not needed by the Mac OS X 10.6 linker but are
             needed by earlier linker tools.

     -warn_compact_unwind
             When producing a final linked image, the linker processes the
             __eh_frame section and produces an __unwind_info section. Most
             FDE entries in the __eh_frame can be represented by a 32-bit
             value in the __unwind_info section.  The option issues a warning
             for any function whose FDE cannot be expressed in the compact
             unwind format.

     -warn_weak_exports
             Issue a warning if the resulting final linked image contains weak
             external symbols. Such symbols require dyld to do extra work at
             launch time to coalesce those symbols.

     -no_weak_exports
             Issue an erro if the resulting final linked image contains weak
             external symbols. Such symbols require dyld to do extra work at
             launch time to coalesce those symbols.

     -warn_unused_dylibs
             Warn about dylibs that are linked by no symbols are used from
             them.

     -no_warn_unused_dylibs
             Don't warn about dylibs that are linked by no symbols are used
             from them.

     -dead_strip_dylibs
             Remove dylibs that are unreachable by the entry point or exported
             symbols. That is, suppresses the generation of load command
             commands for dylibs which supplied no symbols during the link.
             This option should not be used when linking against a dylib which
             is required at runtime for some indirect reason such as the dylib
             has an important initializer.

     -allow_sub_type_mismatches
             Normally the linker considers different cpu-subtype for ARM (e.g.
             armv4t and armv6) to be different different architectures that
             cannot be mixed at build time.  This option relaxes that
             requirement, allowing you to mix object files compiled for
             different ARM subtypes.

     -no_uuid
             Do not generate an LC_UUID load command in the output file.  Be
             warned that binaries without UUIDs may cause the debugger and
             crash reporting tools to be unable to track and inspect the
             binary.

     -random_uuid
             Generate a random LC_UUID load command in the output file. By
             default the linker generates the UUID of the output file based on
             a hash of the output file's content. But for very large output
             files, the hash can slow down the link. Using a hash based UUID
             is important for reproducible builds, but if you are just doing
             rapid debug builds, using -random_uuid may improve turn around
             time.

     -root_safe
             Sets the MH_ROOT_SAFE bit in the mach header of the output file.

     -setuid_safe
             Sets the MH_SETUID_SAFE bit in the mach header of the output
             file.

     -interposable
             Indirects access to all to exported symbols when creating a
             dynamic library.

     -init symbol_name
             The specified symbol_name will be run as the first initializer.
             Only used when creating a dynamic library.

     -sub_library library_name
             The specified dylib will be re-exported. For example the
             library_name for /usr/lib/libobjc_profile.A.dylib would be
             libobjc.  Only used when creating a dynamic library.

     -sub_umbrella framework_name
             The specified framework will be re-exported.  Only used when
             creating a dynamic library.

     -allowable_client name
             Restricts what can link against the dynamic library being
             created.  By default any code can link against any dylib. But if
             a dylib is supposed to be private to a small set of clients, you
             can formalize that by adding a -allowable_client for each client.
             If a client is libfoo.1.dylib its -allowable_client name would be
             "foo".  If a client is Foo.framework its -allowable_client name
             would be "Foo".  For the degenerate case where you want no one to
             ever link against a dylib, you can set the -allowable_client to
             "!".

     -client_name name
             Enables a bundle to link against a dylib that was built with
             -allowable_client.  The name specified must match one of the
             -allowable_client names specified when the dylib was created.

     -umbrella framework_name
             Specifies that the dylib being linked is re-exported through an
             umbrella framework of the specified name.

     -headerpad size
             Specifies the minimum space for future expansion of the load
             commands.  Only useful if intend to run install_name_tool to
             alter the load commands later. Size is a hexadecimal number.

     -headerpad_max_install_names
             Automatically adds space for future expansion of load commands
             such that all paths could expand to MAXPATHLEN.  Only useful if
             intend to run install_name_tool to alter the load commands later.

     -bind_at_load
             Sets a bit in the mach header of the resulting binary which tells
             dyld to bind all symbols when the binary is loaded, rather than
             lazily.

     -force_flat_namespace
             Sets a bit in the mach header of the resulting binary which tells
             dyld to not only use flat namespace for the binary, but force
             flat namespace binding on all dylibs and bundles loaded in the
             process.  Can only be used when linking main executables.

     -sectalign segname sectname value
             The section named sectname in the segment segname will have its
             alignment set to value, where value is a hexadecimal number that
             must be an integral power of 2.

     -stack_addr address
             Specifies the initial address of the stack pointer value, where
             value is a hexadecimal number rounded to a page boundary.

     -segprot segname max_prot init_prot
             Specifies the maximum and initial virtual memory protection of
             the named segment, name, to be max and init ,respectively.  The
             values for max and init are any combination of the characters `r'
             (for read), `w' (for write), `x' (for execute) and `-' (no
             access).

     -seg_addr_table filename
             Specifies a file containing base addresses for dynamic libraries.
             Each line of the file is a hexadecimal base address followed by
             whitespace then the install name of the corresponding dylib. The
             # character denotes a comment.

     -segs_read_write_addr address
             Allows a dynamic library to be built where the read-only and
             read-write segments are not contiguous.  The address specified is
             a hexadecimal number that indicates the base address for the
             read-write segments.

     -segs_read_only_addr address
             Allows a dynamic library to be built where the read-only and
             read-write segments are not contiguous.  The address specified is
             a hexadecimal number that indicates the base address for the
             read-only segments.

     -segaddr name address
             Specifies the starting address of the segment named name to be
             address. The address must be a hexadecimal number that is a
             multiple of 4K page size.

     -seg_page_size name size
             Specifies the page size used by the specified segment.  By
             default the page size is 4096 for all segments.  The linker will
             lay out segments such that size of a segment is always an even
             multiple of its page size.

     -dylib_file install_name:file_name
             Specifies that a dynamic shared library is in a different
             location than its standard location. Use this option when you
             link with a library that is dependent on a dynamic library, and
             the dynamic library is in a location other than its default
             location. install_name specifies the path where the library
             normally resides. file_name specifies the path of the library you
             want to use instead. For example, if you link to a library that
             depends upon the dynamic library libsys and you have libsys
             installed in a nondefault location, you would use this option:
             -dylib_file /lib/libsys_s.A.dylib:/me/lib/libsys_s.A.dylib.

     -prebind
             The created output file will be in the prebound format.  This was
             used in Mac OS X 10.3 and earlier to improve launch performance.

     -weak_reference_mismatches treatment
             Specifies what to do if a symbol is weak-imported in one object
             file but not weak-imported in another.  The valid treatments are:
             error, weak, or non-weak.  The default is non-weak.

     -read_only_relocs treatment
             Enables the use of relocations which will cause dyld to modify
             (copy-on-write) read-only pages.  The compiler will normally
             never generate such code.

     -force_cpusubtype_ALL
             The is only applicable with -arch ppc.  It tells the linker to
             ignore the PowerPC cpu requirements (e.g. G3, G4 or G5) encoded
             in the object files and mark the resulting binary as runnable on
             any PowerPC cpu.

     -dylinker_install_name path
             Only used when building dyld.

     -no_arch_warnings
             Suppresses warning messages about files that have the wrong
             architecture for the -arch flag

     -arch_errors_fatal
             Turns into errors, warnings about files that have the wrong
             architecture for the -arch flag.

     -e symbol_name
             Specifies the entry point of a main executable.  By default the
             entry name is "start" which is found in crt1.o which contains the
             glue code need to set up and call main().

     -w      Suppress all warning messages

     -final_output name
             Specifies the install name of a dylib if -install_name is not
             used.  This option is used by compiler driver when it is invoked
             with multiple -arch arguments.

     -arch_multiple
             Specifies that the linker should augment error and warning
             messages with the architecture name.  This option is used by
             compiler driver when it is invoked with multiple -arch arguments.

     -twolevel_namespace_hints
             Specifies that hints should be added to the resulting binary that
             can help speed up runtime binding by dyld as long as the
             libraries being linked against have not changed.

     -dot path
             Create a file at the specified path containing a graph of symbol
             dependencies.  The .dot file can be viewed in GraphViz.

     -keep_relocs
             Add section based relocation records to a final linked image.
             These relocations are ignored at runtime by dyld.

     -warn_stabs
             Print a warning when the linker cannot do a BINCL/EINCL
             optimization because the compiler put a bad stab symbol inside a
             BINCL/EINCL range.

     -warn_commons
             Print a warning whenever a tentative definition in an object file
             is found and a external symbol by the same name is also found in
             a linked dylib.  This often means that the extern keyword is
             missing from a variable declaration in a header file.

     -read_only_stubs
             [i386 only] Makes the __IMPORT segment of a final linked images
             read-only.  This option makes a program slightly more secure in
             that the JMP instructions in the i386 fast stubs cannot be easily
             overwritten by malicious code.  The downside is the dyld must use
             mprotect() to temporarily make the segment writable while it is
             binding the stubs.

     -slow_stubs
             [i386 only]  Instead of using single JMP instruction stubs, the
             linker creates code in the __TEXT segment which calls through a
             lazy pointer in the __DATA segment.

     -interposable_list filename
             The specified filename contains a list of global symbol names
             that should always be accessed indirectly.  For instance, if
             libSystem.dylib is linked such that _malloc is interposable, then
             calls to malloc() from within libSystem will go through a dyld
             stub and could potentially indirected to an alternate malloc.  If
             libSystem.dylib were built without making _malloc interposable
             then if _malloc was interposed at runtime, calls to malloc from
             with libSystem would be missed (not interposed) because they
             would be direct calls.

     -no_function_starts
             By default the linker creates a compress table of function start
             addresses in the LINKEDIT of final linked image.  This option
             disables that behavior.

     -no_objc_category_merging
             By default when producing final linked image, the linker will
             optimize Objective-C classes by merging any categories on a class
             into the class.  Both the class and its categories must be
             defined in the image being linked for the optimization to occur.
             Using this option disables that behavior.

     -objc_relative_method_lists
             By default when producing final linked image, if targeting a new
             enough OS version, the linker will rewrite ObjC method lists from
             the tradition three pointers to use three read-only delta
             pointers. This option allows you to force the use of relative
             method lists even though the OS version is too low.

     -no_objc_relative_method_lists
             By default when producing final linked image, if targeting a new
             enough OS version, the linker will rewrite ObjC method lists from
             the tradition three pointers to use three read-only delta
             pointers. This option allows you to force the use of traditional
             three pointer method lists.

     -object_path_lto filename
             When performing Link Time Optimization (LTO) and a temporary
             mach-o object file is needed, if this option is used, the
             temporary file will be stored at the specified path and remain
             after the link is complete.  Without the option, the linker picks
             a path and deletes the object file before the linker tool
             completes, thus tools such as the debugger or dsymutil will not
             be able to access the DWARF debug info in the temporary object
             file.

     -lto_library path
             When performing Link Time Optimization (LTO), the linker normally
             loads libLTO.dylib relative to the linker binary
             (../lib/libLTO.dylib). This option allows the user to specify the
             path to a specific libLTO.dylib to load instead.

     -cache_path_lto path
             When performing Incremental Link Time Optimization (LTO), use
             this directory as a cache for incremental rebuild.

     -prune_interval_lto seconds
             When performing Incremental Link Time Optimization (LTO), the
             cache will pruned after the specified interval. A value 0 will
             force pruning to occur and a value of -1 will disable pruning.

     -prune_after_lto seconds
             When pruning the cache for Incremental Link Time Optimization
             (LTO), the cache entries are removed after the specified
             interval.

     -max_relative_cache_size_lto percent
             When performing Incremental Link Time Optimization (LTO), the
             cache will be pruned to not go over this percentage of the free
             space. I.e. a value of 100 would indicate that the cache may fill
             the disk, and a value of 50 would indicate that the cache size
             will be kept under the free disk space.

     -fixup_chains_section
             For use with -static or -preload when -pie is used.  Tells the
             linker to add a __TEXT,__chain_starts section which starts with a
             dyld_chained_starts_offsets struct which specifies the pointer
             format and the offsets to the start of every fixup chain.

     -fixup_chains_section_vm
             Same as -fixup_chains_section but fixes a bug.  The offsets in
             the __chain_starts section are vm-offsets from the __TEXT
             segment, and the rebase targets in the chains are vm-offsets.

     -threaded_starts_section
             For arm64e only.  For use with -static or -preload when -pie is
             used.  Tells the linker to add a __TEXT,__thread_starts section
             which starts with a 32-bit flag field, followed by an array
             32-bit values.  Each value is the offset to the start of a fixup
             chain. This option is deprecated.

     -page_align_data_atoms
             During development, this option can be used to space out all
             global variables so each is on a separate page.  This is useful
             when analyzing dirty and resident pages.  The information can
             then be used to create an order file  to cluster commonly
             used/dirty globals onto the same page(s).

     -not_for_dyld_shared_cache
             Normally, the linker will add extra info to dylibs with
             -install_name starting with /usr/lib or /System/Library/ that
             allows the dylib to be placed into the dyld shared cache.  Adding
             this option tells the linker to not add that extra info.

     -search_in_sparse_frameworks
             For use when linking against versioned frameworks that do not
             have a normal variant.  By default when -framework Foo,_suffix is
             used, the linker will follow Foo.framework/Foo if it is a
             symbolic link, append _suffix and search for a file with that
             path.  When this option is used, the linker will also search for
             Foo.framework/Versions/Current/Foo_suffix.

   Obsolete Options
     -segalign value
             All segments must be page aligned.

     -seglinkedit
             Object files (MH_OBJECT) with a LINKEDIT segment are no longer
             supported. This option is obsolete.

     -noseglinkedit
             This is the default.  This option is obsolete.

     -fvmlib
             Fixed VM shared libraries (MH_FVMLIB) are no longer supported.
             This option is obsolete.

     -sectobjectsymbols segname sectname
             Adding a local label at a section start is no longer supported.
             This option is obsolete.

     -nofixprebinding
             The MH_NOFIXPREBINDING bit of mach_headers has been ignored since
             Mac OS X 10.3.9.  This option is obsolete.

     -noprebind_all_twolevel_modules
             Multi-modules in dynamic libraries have been ignored at runtime
             since Mac OS X 10.4.0.  This option is obsolete.

     -prebind_all_twolevel_modules
             Multi-modules in dynamic libraries have been ignored at runtime
             since Mac OS X 10.4.0.  This option is obsolete.

     -prebind_allow_overlap
             When using -prebind, the linker allows overlapping by default, so
             this option is obsolete.

     -noprebind
             LD_PREBIND is no longer supported as a way to force on
             prebinding, so there no longer needs to be a command line way to
             override LD_PREBIND.  This option is obsolete.

     -sect_diff_relocs treatment
             This option was an attempt to warn about linking .o files
             compiled without -mdynamic-no-pic into a main executable, but the
             false positive rate generated too much noise to make the option
             useful.  This option is obsolete.

     -run_init_lazily
             This option was removed in Mac OS X 10.2.

     -single_module
             This is now the default so does not need to be specified.

     -multi_module
             Multi-modules in dynamic libraries have been ignored at runtime
             since Mac OS X 10.4.0.  This option is obsolete.

     -no_dead_strip_inits_and_terms
             The linker never dead strips initialization and termination
             routines.  They are considered "roots" of the dead strip graph.

     -A basefile
             Obsolete incremental load format.  This option is obsolete.

     -b      Used with -A option to strip base file's symbols.  This option is
             obsolete.  Obsolete option to produce a load map.  Use -map
             option instead.

     -Sn     Don't strip any symbols.  This is the default.  This option is
             obsolete.

     -Si     Optimize stabs debug symbols to remove duplicates.  This is the
             default.  This option is obsolete.

     -Sp     Write minimal stabs which causes the debugger to open and read
             the original .o file for full stabs.  This style of debugging is
             obsolete in Mac OS X 10.5.  This option is obsolete.

     -X      Strip local symbols that begin with 'L'.  This is the default.
             This option is obsolete.

     -s      Completely strip the output, including removing the symbol table.
             This file format variant is no longer supported.  This option is
             obsolete.

     -m      Don't treat multiple definitions as an error.  This is no longer
             supported. This option is obsolete.

     -ysymbol
             Display each file in which symbol is used.  This was previously
             used to debug where an undefined symbol was used, but the linker
             now automatically prints out all usages.  The -why_live option
             can also be used to display what kept a symbol from being dead
             striped.  This option is obsolete.

     -Y number
             Used to control how many occurrences of each symbol specified
             with -y would be shown.  This option is obsolete.

     -nomultidefs
             Only used when linking an umbrella framework.  Sets the
             MH_NOMULTIDEFS bit in the mach_header.  The MH_NOMULTIDEFS bit
             has been obsolete since Mac OS X 10.4.  This option is obsolete.

     -multiply_defined_unused treatment
             Previously provided a way to warn or error if any of the symbol
             definitions in the output file matched any definitions in dynamic
             library being linked.  This option is obsolete.

     -multiply_defined treatment
             Previously provided a way to warn or error if any of the symbols
             used from a dynamic library were also available in another linked
             dynamic library.  This option is obsolete.

     -private_bundle
             Previously prevented errors when -flat_namespace, -bundle, and
             -bundle_loader were used and the bundle contained a definition
             that conflicted with a symbol in the main executable.  The linker
             no longer errors on such conflicts.  This option is obsolete.

     -noall_load
             This is the default.  This option is obsolete.

     -seg_addr_table_filename path
             Use path instead of the install name of the library for matching
             an entry in the seg_addr_table.  This option is obsolete.

     -sectorder segname sectname orderfile
             Replaced by more general -order_file option.

     -sectorder_detail
             Produced extra logging about which entries from a sectorder
             entries were used.  Replaced by -order_file_statistics.  This
             option is obsolete.

     -lazy_framework name[,suffix]
             This is the same as the -framework name[,suffix] except that the
             linker will construct glue code so that the framework is not
             loaded until the first function in it is called.  You cannot
             directly access data or Objective-C classes in a framework linked
             this way. This option is deprecated.

     -lazy-lx
             This is the same as the -lx but it is only for shared libraries
             and the linker will construct glue code so that the shared
             library is not loaded until the first function in it is called.
             This option is deprecated.

     -lazy_library path_to_library
             This is the same as listing a file name path to a shared library
             on the link line except that the linker will construct glue code
             so that the shared library is not loaded until the first function
             in it is called. This option is deprecated.
