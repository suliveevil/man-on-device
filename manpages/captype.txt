NAME
       captype - Prints the types of capture files

SYNOPSIS
       captype [ -h ] [ -v ] <infile> ...

DESCRIPTION
       Captype is a program that opens one or more capture files and prints
       the capture file type of each <infile>.

       Captype is able to detect and read the same capture files that are
       supported by Wireshark.  The input files donâ€™t need a specific filename
       extension; the file format and an optional gzip, zstd or lz4
       compression will be automatically detected.  Near the beginning of the
       DESCRIPTION section of wireshark(1) or
       <https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html> is a detailed
       description of the way Wireshark handles this, which is the same way
       Captype handles this.

DIAGNOSTIC OPTIONS
       --log-level <level>
           Set the active log level.  Supported levels in lowest to highest
           order are "noisy", "debug", "info", "message", "warning",
           "critical", and "error".  Messages at each level and higher will be
           printed, for example "warning" prints "warning", "critical", and
           "error" messages and "noisy" prints all messages.  Levels are case
           insensitive.

       --log-fatal <level>
           Abort the program if any messages are logged at the specified level
           or higher.  For example, "warning" aborts on any "warning",
           "critical", or "error" messages.

       --log-domains <list>
           Only print messages for the specified log domains, e.g.
           "GUI,Epan,sshdump".  List of domains must be comma-separated.

       --log-debug <list>
           Force the specified domains to log at the "debug" level.  List of
           domains must be comma-separated.

       --log-noisy <list>
           Force the specified domains to log at the "noisy" level.  List of
           domains must be comma-separated.

       --log-file <path>
           Write log messages and stderr output to the specified file.
