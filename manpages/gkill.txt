       Send signals to processes, or list signals.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options
       too.

       -s, --signal=SIGNAL, -SIGNAL

              specify the name or number of the signal to be sent

       -l, --list
              list signal names, or convert signal names to/from numbers

       SIGNAL may be a signal name like 'HUP', or a signal number like '1', or
       the exit status of a process terminated by a signal.  PID is an
       integer; if negative it identifies a process group.

       NOTE: your shell may have its own version of kill, which usually
       supersedes the version described here.  Please refer to your shell's
       documentation for details about the options it supports.
