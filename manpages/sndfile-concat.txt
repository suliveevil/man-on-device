NAME
     sndfile-concat â€“ concatenate audio data from two or more audio files

SYNOPSIS
     sndfile-concat infile1 infile2 ... outfile

DESCRIPTION
     sndfile-concat generates a new output file by concatenating the audio
     data of two or more input files. The encoding of the output file is the
     encoding used in infile1.  Audio data from the subsequent files are
     converted to this encoding.  The only restriction is that the files must
     have the same number of channels.  The output file is overwritten if it
     already exists.

EXIT STATUS
     The sndfile-concat utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
