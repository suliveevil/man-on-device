NAME
       swift -- Safe, fast, and expressive general-purpose programming
       language

SYNOPSIS
       To invoke the Swift REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop):

           swift

       To execute a Swift program:

           swift program.swift <arguments>

       To work with the Swift Package Manager:

           swift build|package|run|test [options] <inputs>

       To invoke the Swift compiler:

           swiftc [options] <inputs>

       A list of supported options is available through the "-help" option:

           swift -help

           swift build -help

           swiftc -help

DESCRIPTION
       Swift is a general-purpose programming language built using a modern
       approach to safety, performance, and software design patterns.

       The goal of the Swift project is to create the best available language
       for uses ranging from systems programming, to mobile and desktop apps,
       scaling up to cloud services. Most importantly, Swift is designed to
       make writing and maintaining correct programs easier for the developer.
       To achieve this goal, we believe that the most obvious way to write
       Swift code must also be:

       Safe. The most obvious way to write code should also behave in a safe
       manner.  Undefined behavior is the enemy of safety, and developer
       mistakes should be caught before software is in production. Opting for
       safety sometimes means Swift will feel strict, but we believe that
       clarity saves time in the long run.

       Fast. Swift is intended as a replacement for C-based languages (C, C++,
       and Objective-C). As such, Swift must be comparable to those languages
       in performance for most tasks. Performance must also be predictable and
       consistent, not just fast in short bursts that require clean-up later.
       There are lots of languages with novel features - being fast is rare.

       Expressive. Swift benefits from decades of advancement in computer
       science to offer syntax that is a joy to use, with modern features
       developers expect. But Swift is never done. We will monitor language
       advancements and embrace what works, continually evolving to make Swift
       even better.

BUGS
       Reporting bugs is a great way for anyone to help improve Swift. The bug
       tracker for Swift, an open-source project, is located at
       <https://bugs.swift.org>.

       If a bug can be reproduced only within an Xcode project or a
       playground, or if the bug is associated with an Apple NDA, please file
       a report to Apple's Feedback Assistant at
       <https://feedbackassistant.apple.com> instead.
