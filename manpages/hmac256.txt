NAME
       hmac256 - Compute an HMAC-SHA-256 MAC

SYNOPSIS
       hmac256 [--binary] key [FILENAME]


DESCRIPTION
       This is a standalone HMAC-SHA-256 implementation used to compute an
       HMAC-SHA-256 message authentication code.  The tool has originally been
       developed as a second implementation for Libgcrypt to allow comparing
       against the primary implementation and to be used for internal
       consistency checks.  It should not be used for sensitive data because
       no mechanisms to clear the stack etc are used.

       The code has been written in a highly portable manner and requires only
       a few standard definitions to be provided in a config.h file.


       hmac256 is commonly invoked as

         hmac256 "This is my key" foo.txt


       This compute the MAC on the file ‘foo.txt’ using the key given on the
       command line.


OPTIONS
       hmac256 understands these options:



       --binary
              Print the MAC as a binary string.  The default is to print the
              MAC encoded as lower case hex digits.


       --version
              Print version of the program and exit.
