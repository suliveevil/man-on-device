NAME
       mid3cp - copy ID3 tags

SYNOPSIS
       mid3cp [options] source dest

DESCRIPTION
       mid3cp copies the ID3 tags from a source file to a destination file.

       It is designed to provide similar functionality to id3lib's id3cp tool,
       and can optionally write ID3v1 tags. It can also exclude specific tags
       from being copied.

OPTIONS

       --verbose, -v
              Be verbose: state all operations performed, and list tags in
              source file.

       --write-v1
              Write ID3v1 tags to the destination file, derived from the ID3v2
              tags.

       --exclude-tag, -x
              Exclude a specific tag from being copied. Can be specified
              multiple times.

       --merge
              Copy over frames instead of replacing the whole ID3 tag. The tag
              version of dest will be used. In case dest has no ID3 tag this
              option has no effect.
