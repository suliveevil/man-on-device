NAME
     sndfile-interleave, sndfile-deinterleave – convert mono files into a
     multi-channel file and vice versa

SYNOPSIS
     sndfile-interleave input1 input2 ... -o output
     sndfile-deinterleave file

DESCRIPTION
     sndfile-interleave creates a multi-channel file taking audio data from
     two or more mono files as individual channels.  The format of the output
     file is determined by its filename suffix.  The audio parameters of the
     output file will be made so that the format can accommodate each of the
     mono inputs; for example, the samplerate will be the maximal samplerate
     occurring in the inputs.  The output file will be overwritten if it
     already exists.

     sndfile-deinterleave creates two or more mono files from a multi-channel
     audio file, containing data from the individual channels. The names of
     the resulting mono files are of the form “name_XY.suf” where name and suf
     are the basename and suffix of the original file.  If any file of such
     name already exists, it will be overwritten.  Apart from the number of
     channels, the audio format of the resulting mono files is the same as
     that of the original file.

EXIT STATUS
     The sndfile-interleave utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error
     occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Merge a mono OGG file and a mono FLAC file into a stereo WAV file:

           $ sndfile-interleave left.ogg right.flac -o stereo.wav

     Split a multi-channel into individual mono files:

           $ sndfile-deinterleave multi.wav
           Input file : multi
           Output files :
               multi_00.wav
               multi_01.wav
               multi_02.wav
               multi_03.wav
