NAME
     sndfile-salvage â€“ salvage audio data from WAV files longer than 4G

SYNOPSIS
     sndfile-salvage toolong.wav fixed64.wav

DESCRIPTION
     Audio files using the WAV file container are inherently limited to 4G of
     data size fields in the WAV header being stored as unsigned 32bit
     integers.  Many applications have trouble with these WAV files that are
     more the 4G in size.  sndfile-salvage rewrites the WAV file into a W64
     file with the same audio content.  This file is overwritten if it already
     exists.

EXIT STATUS
     The sndfile-salvage utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error
     occurs.
