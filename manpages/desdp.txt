NAME
     desdp – scripting definition generator

SYNOPSIS
     desdp application

DESCRIPTION
     desdp generates a scripting definition (“sdef”) from the specified
     scriptable application and writes it to standard output.  The original
     dictionary may be either an aete resource or a set of Cocoa suite
     definition files (scriptSuite/scriptTerminology pairs).

     desdp is primarily useful for developers with an existing scriptable
     application who want a shortcut to creating an sdef(5) file.  While the
     resulting sdef will contain all the information in the original
     dictionary, it will probably not be perfect, since sdef(5) is more
     expressive than either of the older aete or suite definition formats.
     For instance, aete cannot specify which commands an object responds to,
     and suite definitions cannot specify the ordering of terms.

SEE ALSO
     sdef(5), sdp(1)

BUGS
     desdp does not yet correctly support Cocoa “Synonym” sections or
     synonymous terms or codes in aete.
