NAME
       srptool - GnuTLS SRP tool

SYNOPSIS
       srptool [-flags] [-flag [value]] [--option-name[[=| ]value]]

       All arguments must be options.

DESCRIPTION
       Simple program that emulates the programs in the Stanford SRP (Secure
       Remote Password) libraries using GnuTLS.  It is intended for use in
       places where you don't expect SRP authentication to be the used for
       system users.

       In  brief,  to use SRP you need to create two files. These are the
       password file that holds the users and the verifiers associated with
       them  and  the configuration file to hold the group parameters (called
       tpasswd.conf).


OPTIONS
       -d num, --debug=num
              Enable debugging.  This option takes an integer number as its
              argument.  The value of num is constrained to being:
                  in the range 0 through 9999

              Specifies the debug level.

       -i num, --index=num
              This option takes an integer number as its argument.  The
              default number for this option is:
                   3


       -u str, --username=str

       -p str, --passwd=str

       -s num, --salt=num
              This option takes an integer number as its argument.

       --verify
              Verifies the password provided against the password file.

       -v str, --passwd-conf=str
              Specify a filename or a PKCS #11 URL to read the CAs from.

       --create-conf=str
              Generate a password configuration file.

              This generates a password configuration file (tpasswd.conf)
              containing the required for TLS parameters.

       -v arg, --version=arg
              Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v', a
              simple version.  The `c' mode will print copyright information
              and `n' will print the full copyright notice.

       -h, --help
              Display usage information and exit.

       -!, --more-help
              Pass the extended usage information through a pager.



EXAMPLES
       To create tpasswd.conf which holds the g and n values for SRP protocol
       (generator and a large prime), run:
           $ srptool --create-conf /etc/tpasswd.conf

       This command will create /etc/tpasswd and will add user 'test' (you
       will also be prompted for a password). Verifiers are stored by default
       in the way libsrp expects.
           $ srptool --passwd /etc/tpasswd --passwd-conf /etc/tpasswd.conf -u test


       This command will check against a password. If the password matches the
       one in /etc/tpasswd you will get an ok.
           $ srptool --passwd /etc/tpasswd --passwd\-conf /etc/tpasswd.conf --verify -u test

EXIT STATUS
       One of the following exit values will be returned:

       0  (EXIT_SUCCESS)
              Successful program execution.

       1  (EXIT_FAILURE)
              The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
