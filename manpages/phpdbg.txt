DESCRIPTION
       phpdbg is a lightweight, powerful, easy to use debugging platform for
       PHP.

OPTIONS
       -c path|file   Look for php.ini file in the directory path or use the
                      specified file

       -d foo[=bar]   Define INI entry foo with value bar

       -n             No php.ini file will be used

       -z file        Load Zend extension file

       -q             Do not print banner on startup

       -v             Enable oplog output

       -b             Disables use of color on the console

       -i path|file   Override .phpgdbinit location (implies -I)

       -I             Ignore .phpdbginit (default init file)

       -r             Jump straight to run

       -e             Generate extended information for debugger/profiler

       -E             Enable step through eval()

                      argument starts with '-' or script is read from stdin

       returning to the console
