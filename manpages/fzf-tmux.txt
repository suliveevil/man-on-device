NAME
       fzf-tmux - open fzf in tmux split pane


SYNOPSIS
       fzf-tmux [LAYOUT OPTIONS] [--] [FZF OPTIONS]


DESCRIPTION
       fzf-tmux is a wrapper script for fzf that opens fzf in a tmux split
       pane or in a tmux popup window. It is designed to work just like fzf
       except that it does not take up the whole screen. You can safely use
       fzf-tmux instead of fzf in your scripts as the extra options will be
       silently ignored if you're not on tmux.
