NAME
       guile - The GNU Project Extension Language

SYNOPSIS
       guile [-L DIRECTORY] [-l FILE] [-e FUNCTION] [\] [-c EXPR] [-s SCRIPT]
       [--] [SCRIPT [ARGs_for_SCRIPT]]

       Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the
       remainder.

DESCRIPTION
       GNU Guile is an implementation of the Scheme programming language.  It
       extends the R5RS and R6RS language standards, providing additional
       features necessary for real-world use.

       Guile works well for interactive use, basic scripting, and extension of
       larger applications, as well as for stand-alone Scheme application
       development.

       The guile executable itself provides a stand-alone interactive compiler
       and run-time for Scheme programs, both for interactive use and for
       executing Scheme scripts or programs.

       This manual page provides only brief instruction in invoking guile from
       the command line.  Please consult the Guile info documentation for more
       information, (type  info "(guile)Invoking Guile" at a command prompt).

OPTIONS
       -L_DIRECTORY
              Add DIRECTORY to the front of Guile's module load path.

       -l_FILE
              Load Scheme source code from FILE.

       -e_FUNCTION
              After reading SCRIPT, apply FUNCTION to command-line arguments.
              Note that FUNCTION is evaluated, so, for example, (@ (my-module)
              my-proc) is valid here.

       \      The "meta switch", used to work around limitations in #!
              scripts.  See "The Meta Switch" in the texinfo documentation for
              more details.

       --     Stop argument processing, and start guile in interactive mode.

       -c_EXPR
              Stop argument processing, and evaluate EXPR as a Scheme
              expression.

       -s_SCRIPT-FILE
              Load Scheme source from SCRIPT-FILE and execute as a script.
              Note that in many cases it is not necessary to use -s; one may
              invoke guile simply as guile SCRIPT-FILE ARG...

       -ds    Carry out -s SCRIPT at this point in the option sequence.  Note
              that this argument must be used in conjunction with -s.

       --debug
              Start guile with the debugging VM.  By default, debugging is on
              when guile is invoked interactively; it is off otherwise.

       --no-debug
              Start guile without the debugging VM, even if guile is being run
              interactively.

       --auto-compile
              Compile source files automatically (default behavior).

       --no-auto-compile
              Disable automatic source file compilation.

       --listen[=P]
              Listen on a port or socket for remote REPL connections.  See the
              manual for more details.

       --use-srfi=N,M...
              Load SRFI extensions N, M, etc.  For example,  --use-srfi=8,13.

       -x_EXTENSION
              Add EXTENSION to the guile load extension list.

       -h, --help
              Describe command-line options and exit.

       -v, --version
              Display guile version and exit.

       -q     In interactive mode, suppress loading the user's initialization
              file, ~/.guile.

ENVIRONMENT
       GUILE_LOAD_PATH
              If $GUILE_LOAD_PATH is set before guile is started, its value is
              used to augment the path to search for Scheme files when
              loading.  It should be a colon-separated list of directories,
              which will be prefixed to the default %load-path.

       GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH
              If $GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH is set before guile is started, its
              value is used to augment the path to search for compiled Scheme
              files (.go files) when loading.  It should be a colon-separated
              list of directories, which will be prefixed to the default
              %load-compiled-path.

FILES
       ~/.guile
              A Guile script that is executed before any other processing
              occurs.  For example, the following .guile activates guile's
              readline interface:

                (use-modules (ice-9 readline))
                (activate-readline)

SEE ALSO
       The full documentation for Guile is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If
       the info and guile programs are properly installed at your site, the
       command

              info guile

       should give you access to the complete manual.

       http://www.schemers.org provides a general introduction to the Scheme
       language.

REPORTING BUGS
       There is a mailing list, bug-guile@gnu.org, for reporting Guile bugs
       and fixes.  But before reporting something as a bug, please try to be
       sure that it really is a bug, not a misunderstanding or a deliberate
       feature.  We ask you to read the section ``Reporting Bugs'' in the
       Guile reference manual (or Info system) for hints on how and when to
       report bugs.  Also, include the version number of the Guile you are
       running in every bug report that you send in.  Bugs tend actually to
       get fixed if they can be isolated, so it is in your interest to report
       them in such a way that they can be easily reproduced.
